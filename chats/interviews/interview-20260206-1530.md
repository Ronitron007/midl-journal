# Interview: Pitching MIDL Journal to Stephen Procter

Date: 2026-02-06

## Context

Rohan wants to pitch MIDL Journal — an AI-powered meditation companion app built around Stephen Procter's MIDL 17-skill system — to Stephen himself. Stephen is Rohan's meditation teacher. The goal is to see if Stephen wants to co-own and direct the app while Rohan handles the tech.

## Key Decisions

- First conversation is a show-and-tell, not a formal pitch. Student showing teacher something he built for his own practice.
- Lead with the personal story: "I built this for my own journaling and pre-sit preparation because I found gaps in my practice."
- Be honest about scraping: "I scraped your content because I wanted to see what I could build with it for my own use. I never intended to put it out without your involvement."
- Pricing philosophy: transparent, infrastructure-cost-based, capped developer cut, dana-compatible. Students pay for AI inference, not for Stephen's teachings.
- If Stephen says no to any use of his IP, Rohan will respect that fully — willing to kill the project.

## The Pitch (Distilled)

"I'm a student of yours. I built a journaling tool for my own practice because I wanted pre-sit preparation and post-sit reflection. It uses your skill framework because that's what I practice. I'd love to show you what I made and see if it's something you'd want your students to have."

## Identified Risks / Weak Spots

- **IP conversation is unavoidable.** Content was scraped without prior permission. Framing matters — "I built this for myself" is honest and disarming, but must be said upfront.
- **No clear problem Stephen has.** He's a dana-based teacher, likely content with his current setup (website, YouTube, SoundCloud). The pitch is "opportunity you didn't know you had" rather than "fix for your pain point."
- **"Everything is yours, I just execute" risks underselling Rohan.** Stephen needs a partner with conviction, not a contractor. Rohan should own his expertise (AI, product, tech) while deferring on meditation pedagogy.
- **Co-ownership is vague.** Revenue split, decision-making authority, IP ownership — none of this is defined. Fine for first conversation, but needs clarity before any real collaboration starts.
- **Demo logistics unknown.** Don't know Stephen's device. Plan to screen-share initially.

## Suggested Ask (Low-Commitment)

"Would you be open to trying this with a few students and seeing if it helps?"
— Gives Stephen a path to engage without committing to co-ownership, revenue, or anything formal.

## Open Questions

- What device does Stephen use? (TestFlight vs screen-share)
- Does Stephen have any existing frustration with student engagement/retention?
- What's the ballpark number for the capped developer cut?
- Is there a next MIDL retreat or class where a pilot with students could happen naturally?
- How does Stephen currently track student progression through the 17 skills? (Manual? Not at all?)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Draft a short, casual message to Stephen requesting a call — not a pitch deck, just "I made something I'd love to show you"
- [ ] Prepare a 5-min screen-share demo walkthrough: onboarding → tracker → reflect with nudges → AI chat with skill knowledge
- [ ] Have a clean one-liner ready for the scraping question
- [ ] Think through the "what if he says no" conversation so it doesn't catch you off guard
- [ ] Decide on ballpark pricing/cap numbers before the call (don't need to share, but need to have thought about it)
