13 Meditative Hindrances
There are sequential habitual imbalances in effort and the structure of attention that hinder the
development of samatha calm during mindfulness of breathing. These are known as 13 Meditative
Hindrances and are seen by the MIDL meditator as opportunities for insight into anicca & anatta.
