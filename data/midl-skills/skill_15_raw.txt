     2→Cultivation: PLEASURE JHANA & EQUANIMITY
     3→Name: Third Pleasure Jhana
     4→Subtitle: How to transform joyful happiness into equanimous contentment
     5→
     6→Quote: "With the fading of joy & piti, equanimous, mindful, with clear comprehension, experiencing the pleasure of happiness within the body, they enter & dwell within the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones say: 'Equanimous & mindful, they have a pleasant abiding'." The Buddha, MN119.
     7→
     8→Overview:
     9→As the bubbly happiness of the Second Pleasure Jhana subsides, awareness rests in the subtler feeling of happy contentment, and your mind, losing interest in the uplifting feeling of joyfulness, flows with and absorbs into the feeling of happy contentment, entering the Third Pleasure Jhana.
    10→
    11→Duration:
    12→Meditation Length: 60 minutes, 2-3 times daily, plus developing a continuity of contentment in your daily life is beneficial. The third pleasure jhana requires a simplification of your life, adherence to sila (morality) and inclining your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful). Organised Buddhist meditation retreats create the perfect conditions for accelerating your practice from this point.
    13→
    14→Benefits:
    15→Entering and abiding in the deep contentment and unmoving samadhi of the third pleasure jhana during seated meditation will create the conditions for maturing all Seven Awakening Factors once you finish seated meditation. This will allow you to develop deep insight after seated meditation and in your daily life.

    17→Summary:
    18→Unify in the foreground in the subtle experience of happiness and contentment in your heart's centre, and allow the uplifting experience of joyfulness of mind to fade in the background peripheral awareness.
    19→
    20→Step-by-Step Instructions:
    21→
    22→The third pleasure jhana is characterised by very still, unmoving awareness due to complete absorption into the heartfelt feeling of happy contentment. To create the conditions for the third pleasure jhana, spend more time developing contentment during meditation and daily life.
    23→
    24→Step 1: Spend more time deepening samadhi in access concentration.
    25→When establishing access concentration, spend more time resting in it and avoid rushing to enter the first pleasure jhana. In preparation for the third pleasure jhana, stay longer in access concentration until your samadhi becomes very firm and unmoving, and the experience of sukha, as an uplifting, joyful happiness, comes to the forefront of your awareness.
    26→
    27→Step 2: Develop and absorb into the first pleasure jhana.
    28→Develop the first pleasure jhana, as you did in Meditation Skill 13, by focusing attention on a clear, pleasant feeling of piti in your body. When the conditions are right, the wholesome, pleasant feeling of piti will gradually grow and flow through your mind and body, filling your awareness. When mature, your mind will autonomously absorb and flow with this experience. When this occurs, your awareness has shifted the sensory world to the first pleasure jhana.
    28→When you access the first pleasure jhana, the blissful, pleasant experience of piti will be subtler due to the increased sukha developed in access concentration, and your mind will quickly go through the first pleasure jhana because of this inclination of your mind to rest in the second pleasure jhana.
    29→
    30→Step 3: Develop and absorb into the second pleasure jhana.
    31→Develop the second pleasure jhana, as you did in Meditation Skill 14, by focusing attention toward a clear, pleasant feeling of sukha (happiness of heart or joyfulness of mind) in your heart and mind. Once sukha is the foreground experience in your awareness, allow it to rest there and grow. The pleasant feeling of piti will gradually fade into the background due to inattention, and the happiness and joyfulness of sukha will become the dominant experience due to the focus of your mind toward it.
    31→As your experience of sukha moves to the foreground, gently rest your awareness in this experience and allow it to flow within your awareness. Your awareness will gradually absorb the joyful feeling, and a flow of happiness from your heart will arise to enter the second pleasure jhana.
    32→
    33→Step 4: Learn to separate sukha into joyfulness of mind & happiness of heart.
    34→As the pleasant feeling of piti fades, becoming very subtle in the background in the second pleasure jhana, you will notice that sukha is comprised of two parts: an uplifting joyfulness of mind and a bubbling happiness flowing from your heart. Once this becomes clear, you can separate these two by seeing the grossness of the joyfulness and by inclining your awareness toward calming the energetic quality of the bubbling feeling of happiness.
    35→
    36→Step 5: Rest awareness on the feeling of happiness, bringing it to the foreground.
    37→Begin to calm the energetic quality of the happiness of heart by gently softening your interest in it and inclining your mind toward a deeper feeling of contentment within your body. Allow your awareness to rest more deeply in your body, and as you do this, the energy of joyfulness will calm, leaving a feeling of happy contentment of heart, which will begin to fill your foreground experience as content grows, becoming still and unmoving.
    38→
    39→Step 6: Allow your mind to absorb into the third pleasure jhana.
    40→Allow your mind to rest in and flow with the feeling of happy contentment in your heart's centre. Your mind will gradually absorb into the flow, and there will arise the experience of a complete absorption of your mind. The experience of this will be entering a subtle, deeply calm, happy contentment of heart that is free from any sense of movement and completely still.
    40→The experience of the third pleasure jhana is one of vast stillness, being deeply serene, tranquil, peaceful, unmoving contentment that is deeply satisfying, with an extremely clear clarity of mindfulness with clear comprehension of just these qualities of the third pleasure jhana.
    41→
    42→Step 7: Pervade your body and mind with the satisfying feeling of happy contentment.
    43→Expand awareness to all parts of your body and mind, allowing the pleasure of feeling deeply happy and content to pervade them until they become steady, firm, and unmoving in samadhi. When your mind enjoys this pleasure of the happy feeling of contentment, it will become unmoving, still and tranquil. Equanimity towards the subtle pleasant feeling still present in the third pleasure jhana will start to arise within your mind as samadhi matures and your mind inclines toward the fourth pleasure jhana.

    45→Sutta Reference:
    46→"Furthermore, with the fading of blissful feelings in body & mind, the meditator dwells equanimous, mindful & clearly comprehending, experiencing happiness in their body. In this way, they enter & dwell in the third jhana, of which Noble Ones say: One who is equanimous & mindful has a pleasant abiding."
    47→
    48→"They permeate and pervade, saturate and fill their body with happiness free from blissful feelings."
    49→
    50→"Just as lotuses growing in a pond may stay immersed in the water without breaking the surface and still flourish, they are permeated and pervaded, saturated and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips so that no part of them is unpervaded by it."
    51→
    52→"In this way, a meditator permeates and pervades, saturates and fills their body with happiness free from blissful feelings, so that no part of their body is unpervaded by this happiness."
    53→
    54→"And as they remain heedful, ardent, and resolute, memories and resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning, their mind gathers and settles inwardly, grows unified and collected." The Buddha, Kaya-Gata Sati Sutta, MN 119.

    56→How to Use Jhana to Develop Sotapanna-Insight:
    57→
    57→As soon as you begin developing your skill in the third pleasure jhana, you can start developing insight into anicca and anatta at the end of each seated meditation session.
    58→
    59→Sotapanna (Stream Entry) is the first of four mature insights leading to the experience of Nibbana that will permanently uproot specific fetters (that which binds) from your mind. The first three fetters removed through insight are:
    60→- Attachment to view of permanent self (uprooted through insight into anicca and anatta)
    61→- Hindrance of doubt (uprooted through saddha/verified faith)
    62→- Attachment to rites & rituals (uprooted through insight into idappaccayatā: specific conditionality)
    63→
    64→Reason for Developing Pleasure Jhana Before Sotapanna-Insight:
    65→The reason for developing the samatha jhanas up to the fourth pleasure jhana is that they create the conditions for all Seven Awakening Factors to develop and remain within the meditator's mind after seated meditation in preparation for Sotapanna-Insight. The pleasure jhanas are the easiest way to do this in daily life and also in a retreat setting. Developing pleasure jhana based on a momentum of letting go during mindfulness of breathing and a foundation of enjoyment of mindfulness of your body has the added benefit of weakening the hindrances within your mind before developing jhana. This particular way of training your mind during insight meditation enhances the conditions for the complete letting go of all experience and experiencing necessary for Sotapanna-insight.
    66→
    67→Creating Conditions for Sotapanna-Insight from Third Pleasure Jhana:
    68→You can begin to create the conditions for Sotapanna-Insight from the third pleasure jhana onwards by sitting in meditation and developing and absorbing into the third pleasure jhana for the period of your meditation. Remain seated for a while after you finish meditation and be curious about the fading of the jhana factors from your mind and the re-arising of the engagement of your mind with your six sense fields as your mind emerges from jhana and you enter your day. You can enhance this insight by precise investigations into the anatta (autonomous nature) and idappaccayatā: specific conditionality of all experience and experiencing.

    70→Seven Awakening Factors:
    71→1. Mindfulness
    72→2. Curiosity
    73→3. Balanced Effort
    74→4. Meditative Joy
    75→5. Tranquillity
    76→6. Unification of Mind
    77→7. Equanimity
    78→
    79→During mindfulness of breathing, you developed the first six Awakening Factors once you established samadhi in access concentration. As you entered the pleasure jhana you gradually abandoned Awakening Factors to reach deeper states of letting go in jhana.
    80→
    81→Awakening Factors in the Third Pleasure Jhana:
    82→- Mindfulness
    83→- Balanced Effort
    84→- Tranquillity
    85→- Unification of Mind
    86→
    87→Rebuilding the Awakening Factors for Insight:
    88→Accessing the third pleasure jhana requires letting go of the Awakening Factors of curiosity and meditative joy. To develop insight after your meditation and during the day, you need to reestablish the second and fourth Awakening Factors. The conditions for the seventh Awakening Factor, equanimity, can be developed from the third pleasure jhana by integrating periods of continuous noticing in a retreat environment to develop khanika samadhi (momentary unification) to a jhanic level.
    89→
    90→Step 1: Arouse Curiosity.
    91→When your mind emerges from the third pleasure jhana, arouse the Awakening Factor of curiosity within your mind by taking an interest in and observing the fading of the jhana factors and the rearising of the interaction between your mind and sensory experiences. Be curious about the anicca (impermanent) and anatta (autonomous) nature of the jhana factors. Once your mind has reengaged with the sensory world, turn toward the anicca and anatta nature of the coming and going of sensory experience.
    92→
    93→Step 2: Arouse Meditative Joy.
    94→Once curiosity is present within your mind, apply a quality of pleasurable interest in observing the rearising of the interaction between your mind and sensory experiences and appreciating the continuing seclusion of your mind from stimulation that remains. Gently smiling with your eyes will enhance the uplifting experience of joyfulness in your mind.
    95→
    96→Step 3: Optional - Develop Equanimity with Khanika Samadhi.
    97→You can still develop deep insight in Step 4 after emerging from the third pleasure jhana but having the Awakening Factor of equanimity present will significantly increase your insight into anatta and idappaccayatā: specific conditionality.
    97→The conditions for the seventh Awakening Factor: Equanimity can be cultivated outside of samatha jhana, and requires long periods of continuous noticing of the arising and passing of fine sensory input. Combining this with long sitting periods, to develop momentum in khanika samadhi (momentary concentration), makes accessing the fourth vipassana jhana possible. An unstimulated retreat environment is most suitable for this level of khanika samadhi to the jhanic level, and a commitment to continuous mindfulness and noticing throughout the day.
    98→
    99→Step 4: Loosen up Your Samadhi.
    100→When you emerge from the third pleasure jhana, your mind will still be so unified in samadhi that there will be no space for anything to arise. In order to develop insight into anicca and anatta, you need to loosen up your mind's unification so that it can switch to khanika samadhi (momentary unification) for vipassana-insight. Observing the anatta nature of your mind and experiences requires swapping from samatha-based unified attention to vipassana-based momentary unification. Re-establishing a background mindful presence of your body will create a foundation from which you can develop deep insight into anatta and idappaccayatā: specific conditionality.

    102→Progression Criteria:
    103→
    104→You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 16: Fourth Pleasure Jhana when:
    105→- The experience of happiness and pleasantness in the third pleasure jhana gradually becomes more refined and subtle, and the quality of contentment fills the foreground of your awareness, transforming into equanimity as the conditions for the fourth pleasure jhana develop.
