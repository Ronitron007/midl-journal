     3→Name: Second Pleasure Jhana
     4→Subtitle: How to transform blissful pleasure into joyful happiness through refined sukha
     5→
     6→Quote: "With the calming of applied & sustained attention, the meditator enters & dwells within the second jhana, with inner calming & unification of mind, free from thinking & reflection, and filled with blissful feelings in body & mind and joyful happiness born of unification." The Buddha, MN119.
     7→
     8→Overview:
     9→As the experience of the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti calms, intimacy with the joyfulness of mind and happiness of heart (sukha) increases, until your mind flows with and absorbs into it as it enters the second pleasure jhana.
    10→
    11→Duration:
    12→Meditation Length: 60 minutes, 2-3 times daily, to give your mind time to absorb into sukha and abide in the second pleasure jhana. This stage requires a simplification of your life, adherence to sila (morality) and inclining your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful). Organised Buddhist meditation retreats create the perfect conditions for accelerating your practice from this point.
    13→
    14→Benefits:
    15→Regularly entering and experiencing the second pleasure jhana will strengthen your mind's ability to abide in the joyful presence of sukha throughout your day and create an open happy heart of joyful presence as a foundation for the spiritual happiness of the wholesome kusala qualities of gratitude, loving kindness, compassion, generosity, and gentleness in thought, speech and action.

    17→Summary:
    18→Unify in the uplifting experience of joyfulness of mind and happiness of heart (sukha), with the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti significantly calmed and resting in your background peripheral awareness.

    20→Step-by-Step Instructions:
    21→
    22→Step 1: Develop Access Concentration and Deepen Contentment.
    23→To cultivate the conditions for the second pleasure jhana, begin by developing a deeper experience of contentment, enjoyment and tranquillity during mindfulness of breathing, by taking your time experiencing each Marker as it arises. Once your mind reaches access concentration as in Meditation Skill 12, allow your samadhi to become firmer and effortless by inclining your mind toward the joy and happiness of sukha rather than toward the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti in your body.
    24→
    25→Step 2: Absorb into piti for First Pleasure Jhana.
    26→Enter the first pleasure jhana as you did in Meditation Skill 13 and stay within it until its energetic feeling settles down, all thinking is absent, and you mind begins to incline toward a feeling of joyfulness and happiness as your mind has a sense of becoming more stable and unmoving.
    27→
    28→Step 3: Incline your mind toward the joyfulness and happiness of sukha.
    29→The key to moving from the first pleasure jhana to the second pleasure jhana is to shift your interest from the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti to the less stimulated feeling of the joy and happiness of sukha. I recommend doing this by noticing the uplifting feeling of sukha present in the background while in the first pleasure jhana, and then shifting the feeling of piti into the background by softening your interest in it.
    29→To aid in the shift from the first pleasure jhana to the second pleasure jhana, calm your mind's application of attention (vitakka) by softening effort and interest within your mind. As vitakka calms, you will experience your mind as being firm, steady, unmoving on the feeling of joy and happiness of sukha, tranquil and free from any possibility of thinking or doing. You will know you have entered the second pleasure jhana when the feeling of restlessness and stimulation due to vitakka is absent.
    30→
    31→Tip: The blissful, pleasant feeling of piti in the first pleasure jhana comes from growing seclusion of your mind from the six senses. The experience of sukha in the second pleasure jhana comes from further withdrawing of the mind from stimulation and a sense of unmoving stability due to increased intimacy with unification of the mind itself. Softening your mind's interest in the stimulation of the blissful, pleasant piti feeling will allow the experience of piti to rest in the background. Enjoying the less stimulated feeling of sukha will bring it to the foreground and make the joyfulness of your mind and the happiness in your heart (sukha) your main meditation object for the second pleasure jhana with a more refined pleasant feeling of piti in the background.
    32→
    33→Step 4: Absorb into the experience of sukha to enter the second pleasure jhana.
    34→Once sukha is your foreground experience, allow your attention to rest on it and gently stay focused on it, as you did with piti in the first pleasure jhana. Sukha will grow in clarity, and piti will fade into the background. Allow the experience of sukha to begin to flow within your mind. If piti begins to grow again, incline your mind away from the pleasurable experience of piti and toward a feeling of contentment with the growing stability and seclusion of your mind. As you do, your mind will gradually absorb the joyful feeling of sukha into it, and a bubbling flow of happiness will arise from your heart, and your mind will wrap around and immerse itself fully in this flow. When your mind has completely let go of overstimulation of piti and flows with and absorbs into the happiness of sukha, your mind will enter the second pleasure jhana.
    35→
    36→Tip: As your mind enters the second pleasure jhana, you will notice some distinct changes. The blissful, pleasant feeling of piti will still be present but will fade into the background due to inattention. Sukha will become your mind's main experience in the foreground. This will increase the feeling of calm in your mind and body that was absent in the first pleasure jhana. You will still be able to experience piti in the second pleasure jhana, except now it will be experienced as subtle, pleasant sensations in the background with an increasing stability in the experience of joy and happiness at the forefront of your mind. The experience of this can be described as an increased steadiness and firmness of your mind in samadhi, with upwelling, flowing happiness coming from your hearts centre as it opens.
    37→
    38→Step 5: Pervade your body and mind with sukha.
    39→"A meditator permeates & pervades, saturates & fills their body with blissful feelings and joyful happiness born of unification, so that there is no part of their entire body that is unpervaded by blissful feelings & joyful happiness."
    40→To stay longer in the second pleasure jhana, focus on the feeling of happiness flowing out of your heart's centre, bringing awareness to your heart's centre and allowing joy and happiness to flow. To pervade this feeling throughout your body, expand your awareness to all parts of your body and mind, allowing the pleasant piti feeling in the background and the happiness of sukha flowing from your heart to pervade it. Allow your mind to become unified, firm and tranquil on the experience of piti and sukha.
    41→
    42→Step 6: Practice moving between the first and second pleasure jhana.
    43→It is beneficial to learn how to transition between the first and second jhana. To move back to the first pleasure jhana, shift the focus of your mind to the background pleasant feeling of piti, and rest your attention on it until the piti grows and fills the whole of your mind experience. You can then practice moving to the second pleasure jhana in the same way as earlier, by shifting the focus of your mind to the now background experience of the joy and happiness of sukha.
    44→
    45→When you play with this in this way, you will notice a very distinct difference between these pleasure jhanas by practising these transitions. In particular, the grossness of the experience of piti in the first pleasure jhana compared to the tranquility of the second pleasure jhana, in terms of energy and seclusion, will become clear. Like moving from the sounds of nature to a rock concert and back again, the first jhana will appear energetic, compared to the subtlety of the second. Start to experiment with this shift between foreground and peripheral awareness until you can make the pleasant feeling of the piti less intense simply by calming the application of attention towards the piti by your mind.
    46→
    47→In this way, you will learn to differentiate the two pleasure jhanas and sustain attention within the second jhana for more extended periods. Once you can remain sustained in samadhi on the experience of the second pleasure jhana, you can then learn to spread that feeling of joy and happiness of sukha until it fills your whole body, like being draped in a clean light or cloth.

    49→Sutta Reference:
    50→"Furthermore, with the calming of applied & sustained attention, the meditator enters & dwells within the second jhana, with inner calming & unification of mind, free from thinking & reflection, and filled with blissful feelings in body & mind and joyful happiness born of unification."

    52→"They permeate & pervade, saturate & fill their body with blissful feelings and joyful happiness born of unification."

    54→"Just like a lake that has a cool spring bubbling up from within, with no water flowing in from the east, west, north, or south, and not be resupplied from time to time with showers of rain, so that the cool spring within the lake would permeate & pervade, saturate & fill it so that no part of the lake was unpervaded by its cool waters."
    55→
    56→"Similarly, a meditator permeates & pervades, saturates & fills their body with blissful feelings and joyful happiness born of unification, so that there is no part of their entire body that is unpervaded by blissful feelings & joyful happiness."

    58→"As they remain heedful, ardent, and resolute, memories and resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning, their mind gathers and settles inwardly, growing unified and collected." The Buddha, Kaya-Gata Sati Sutta, MN 119.
