# Skill 16: Fourth Pleasure Jhana

Cultivation: 04 - Pleasure Jhana & Equanimity
Subtitle: How to transform contentment into equanimous stillness
Duration: 60 minutes, 2-3 times daily, plus developing continuity of equanimity in daily life. This stage requires a simplification of your life, adherence to sila (morality) and inclining your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful). Organised Buddhist meditation retreats create the perfect conditions for accelerating your practice from this point.

> "Furthermore, with the abandoning of sukha & dukkha, as with the previous passing away of happiness & unhappiness, a meditator enters & dwells in the fourth jhana, which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant and contains mindfulness purified by equanimity." — The Buddha, MN 119

## Overview

As happiness of the third pleasure jhana calms, your mind, resting in neutral contentment, free from happiness and pleasant or unpleasant feelings, will flow with and absorb into an extremely quiet, serene stillness, with clear mindfulness and unmoving equanimity, entering the fourth pleasure jhana.

## Benefits

- Entering and abiding in the deep equanimity and unmoving samadhi of the fourth pleasure jhana will create the conditions for your mind to mature all Seven Awakening Factors when you finish seated meditation and develop deep vipassana insight in your daily life.

## Purpose

Unify in the foreground with the experience of neutral contentment, free from happiness, free from pleasant or unpleasant feelings, while allowing happiness and pleasure to fade into your background, peripheral awareness.

## Instructions

The Fourth Pleasure Jhana is a tranquil, serene stillness characterised by clear, on-looking mindfulness and unmoving equanimity. To create the conditions for it, you must simplify your life, adhere to a code of Sila (morality) that leads to harmony, and incline your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful).

### Step 1: Spend more time deepening samadhi in access concentration

The fourth pleasure jhana requires a deeper and more unified samadhi than the third pleasure jhana. To prepare your mind for the fourth pleasure jhana, develop skills in accessing and dwelling in access concentration for extended periods so that the samadhi in access concentration has time to deepen. When establishing access concentration as in Meditation Skill 12, spend more time resting in it and avoid rushing to enter the first pleasure jhana. In preparation for the fourth pleasure jhana, stay longer in access concentration until your samadhi becomes very firm and unmoving.

Signs that access concentration has deepened are the absence of the five physical senses, and that the scope of your awareness becomes bright. The experience is like sitting in a dark room, and someone opens the curtains, with the sunlight shining through your eyelids. Your mind will become very still and bright as samadhi matures, and your mind will be free from hindrances and sensory stimulation. Using your meditation time to learn to reach access concentration faster, and abiding in it for more extended periods before entering jhana, will aid in developing the amount of samadhi needed to make accessing the fourth pleasure jhana easier.

### Step 2: Develop the third pleasure jhana as you did in Meditation Skill 15

Develop the third pleasure jhana as you did in Meditation Skill 15. The experience of the third pleasure jhana is one of vast stillness, being deeply serene, tranquil, peaceful, content and deeply satisfied, with an extremely clear clarity of mindfulness with clear comprehension of just these qualities.

### Step 3: Learn to separate the feeling of happiness from contentment

As you become fluent in the third pleasure jhana, and dwell in it regularly, it will mature in steadiness of contentment, and the strength of equanimity of your mind will gradually increase. This is experienced as a growing neutrality and disenchantment of heart toward the refined happiness and pleasure accessed within the third pleasure jhana. As neutrality deepens, so will the depth of contentment, equanimity and the firmness of the unmoving stillness of the samadhi present.

### Step 4: Allow your mind to absorb into the fourth pleasure jhana

As neutrality and contentment of heart further deepen, your mind will become disenchanted with the doing of the doer and you will notice it incline in equanimity toward all experience and experiencing. Gently rest your mind on the experience of equanimity plus unmovingness and allow it to fill your foreground experience, with any remnants of pleasantness & happiness fading into the background. Continue to incline toward complete neutrality, relaxing back any interest in experiencing or doing until your awareness flows with and absorbs into this experience.

With the experience of mature equanimity in the fourth pleasure jhana, there will be no disturbance, unmoving steadiness, full clarity of comprehension, and complete seclusion from all sensory input with a clear, still quiet, purity of mind, and complete continuity of mindfulness being your dominant experiences.

### Step 5: Pervade your body and mindfulness with equanimity

Expand and allow the experience of the purity and unmoving equanimity to pervade the whole of your experience so that no part of your experience is unpervaded by it. Allow this experience to become steady, firm, and unmoving in samadhi, enjoying the complete seclusion from sensory stimulation and all doing.

## Sutta Reference

"Furthermore, with the abandoning of sukha & dukkha, as with the previous passing away of happiness & unhappiness, a meditator enters & dwells in the fourth jhana, which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant and contains mindfulness purified by equanimity."

"They sit, pervading their body with pure, bright awareness. The same as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that no part of his body was untouched by this white cloth, a meditator sits, pervading their body with pure, bright awareness so that no part of their body is unpervaded by pure, bright awareness."

"And as they remain heedful, ardent, and resolute, memories and resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning, their mind gathers and settles inwardly, grows unified and collected." — The Buddha, Kaya-Gata Sati Sutta MN 119

## Daily Application

### How to Use Jhana to Develop Sotapanna-Insight

As soon as you begin developing your skill in the fourth pleasure jhana, you can start developing insight into anicca and anatta at the end of each seated meditation session.

Sotapanna (Stream Entry) is the first of four mature insights leading to the experience of Nibbana that will permanently uproot specific fetters (that which binds) from your mind. The first three fetters removed through insight are:
- Attachment to view of permanent self (uprooted through insight into anicca and anatta)
- Hindrance of doubt (uprooted through saddha/verified faith)
- Attachment to rites & rituals (uprooted through insight into idappaccayata: specific conditionality)

### Creating Conditions for Sotapanna-Insight from Fourth Pleasure Jhana

You can begin to create the conditions for Sotapanna-Insight from the fourth pleasure jhana onwards by sitting in meditation and developing and absorbing into the fourth pleasure jhana for the period of your meditation. Remain seated for a while after you finish meditation and be curious about the fading of the jhana factors from your mind and the re-arising of the engagement of your mind with your six sense fields as your mind emerges from jhana and you enter your day. You can enhance this insight by precise investigations into the anatta (autonomous nature) and idappaccayata: specific conditionality of all experience and experiencing.

### Seven Awakening Factors

1. Mindfulness
2. Curiosity
3. Balanced Effort
4. Meditative Joy
5. Tranquillity
6. Unification of Mind
7. Equanimity

During mindfulness of breathing, you developed the first six Awakening Factors once you established samadhi in access concentration. As you entered the pleasure jhana, you gradually abandoned Awakening Factors to reach deeper states of letting go in jhana.

### Awakening Factors in the Fourth Pleasure Jhana

- Mindfulness
- Balanced Effort
- Tranquillity
- Unification of Mind
- Equanimity

### Rebuilding the Awakening Factors for Insight

To develop insight after your meditation and during the day, you need to reestablish the second and fourth Awakening Factors. The advantage of the fourth pleasure jhana is that when your mind emerges, you will have the seventh Awakening Factor of equanimity present within your mind.

### Steps

1. Arouse Curiosity: When your mind emerges from the fourth pleasure jhana, arouse the Awakening Factor of curiosity within your mind by taking an interest in and observing the fading of the jhana factors and the re-arising of the interaction between your mind and sensory experiences. Be curious about the anicca (impermanent) and anatta (autonomous) nature of the jhana factors. Once your mind has reengaged with the sensory world, turn toward the anicca and anatta nature of the coming and going of sensory experience.
2. Arouse Meditative Joy: Once curiosity is present within your mind, apply a quality of pleasurable interest in observing the rearising of the interaction between your mind and sensory experiences and appreciating the continuing seclusion of your mind from any stimulation that remains. Gently smiling with your eyes will enhance the uplifting experience of joyfulness in your mind.
3. Loosen up Your Samadhi: When you emerge from the fourth pleasure jhana, your mind will still be so unified in samadhi that there will be no space for anything to arise. In order to develop insight into anicca and anatta, you need to loosen up your mind's unification so that it can switch to khanika samadhi (momentary unification) for vipassana-insight. Observing the anatta nature of your mind and experiences requires swapping from samatha-based unified attention to vipassana-based momentary unification. Re-establishing a background mindful presence of your body will create a foundation from which you can develop deep insight into anatta and idappaccayata: specific conditionality.
4. Maintain Equanimity: Maintaining equanimity outside of samatha jhana requires long periods of continuous noticing of the arising and passing of fine sensory input in all activities. Combining this with long sitting periods, to develop momentum in khanika samadhi (momentary concentration), makes accessing the fourth vipassana jhana possible and continued equanimity in all activities possible. An unstimulated retreat environment is most suitable for this level of khanika samadhi to the jhanic level of the fourth jhana, and a commitment to continuous mindfulness and noticing throughout the day will maintain this.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress to training for Sotapanna: Stream Entry. Your skill in the samatha (calm) part of the Noble Eightfold Path is now mature, and mindfulness of breathing and accessing the jhanas becomes your daily meditation practice, integrated with periods of insight practice after emerging from jhana, and then carried into walking meditation and mindfulness in daily activities.
