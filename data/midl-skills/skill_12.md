# Skill 12: Access Concentration

Cultivation: 04 - Joyfulness & Unification
Subtitle: How to transform fear of letting go into letting go in access concentration
Duration: 60 minutes, twice per day, to give your mind time to absorb into piti. This stage requires a simplification of your life, adherence to sila (morality) and inclining your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful). Organised Buddhist meditation retreats create the perfect conditions for accelerating your practice from this point.

> "Secluded from the desire for sensory experience, secluded from unwholesome qualities." — The Buddha, MN119

## Overview

As intimacy increases, awareness also becomes steady, firm, unmoving, effortless, and unified, free from all hindrances, with a growing presence of blissful pleasant feelings in the body (piti) and joyful happiness (sukha) within the heart/mind, allowing for access to concentration to establish.

## Benefits

- This Meditation Skill will teach your mind to incline toward and absorb into wholesome (kusala) pleasure in daily life by releasing interest in habitual identification with hindrances and increased disenchantment with sensory stimulation.

## Purpose

To develop your skill in reaching and resting in access concentration in preparation for the first pleasure jhana.

## Instructions

### Preparation: Access Concentration

- Refine your sila (morality) in daily life.
- Incline your mind toward the kusala (wholesome/skilful).
- Calm the desire for sensory pleasure using GOSS.
- Find relaxation, calm and ease as you move around.
- Cultivate and become skilled in the first six Awakening Factors.

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-11

Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-11, except you now add Step 2 as a new addition to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.
- Enjoy the pleasure of your whole body as it breathes.
- Enjoy the pleasantness of piti within your body and mind.

### Step 2: Access Concentration

Continue to increase your minds intimacy with the pleasurable feeling of the piti throughout your body until your samadhi (unification of mind) enters into an autonomous flow with the pleasantness of this experience. As you do, your awareness and attention will merge to become steady, firm, effortless, unmoving, and free from distraction and hindrances, like looking through a still, clean glass window.

Once your mind is unified and stable on the experience of the pleasantness of the piti for at least 15 minutes without any effort or distraction, free from all hindrances, you have reached access concentration (upacara samadhi).

## Tips

- If tranquillity and letting go are mature at access concentration, piti will be calm and unexcited with sukha dominant. If tranquillity and letting go are immature, then piti may arise as quite strong waves of blissful, pleasant feelings that disturb the tranquillity and, at times, are unpleasant.
- As your mind's intimacy with the blissful, pleasant feeling (piti) grows, it will begin to fill the whole of your awareness, and the joyful happiness (sukha) will grow. With this wholesome quality as the object of awareness, all fear of letting go of control will vanish, and your awareness will incline into and rest in this pleasurable feeling of piti and sukha.
- The feeling of piti can vary for everyone and can range from very subtle to a strong flow that shakes or bounces your body. Once all hindrances are suppressed from your mind due to samadhi at Skill 11, the pleasant feeling of piti within your body will grow in strength. If tranquillity is high enough, the experience of piti will be quite beautiful, bringing a natural smile to your face and a feeling of happy joy to your mind.
- As your samadhi matures, sensory stimulation will fade in your awareness. Your mind will begin to replace sensory stimulation with mind-created experiences. A light may appear in your visual field, like someone has opened the curtains and let light into the room. You may even see flickering lights in front of your eyes. This is a direct reflection of the strength of your samadhi and the seclusion of your mind from the six sense fields.
- Once you are comfortable reaching access concentration and resting in it, focus on developing the speed at which you can reach it during mindfulness of breathing. It is important to continue developing mindfulness of breathing based on a momentum of letting go, rather than effort so that an inclination toward letting go increases within your mind.

## Obstacles

### Fear of Letting Go

Fear of Letting Go refers to the deeply seated fear of giving up control to the momentum of letting go within your mind. Like a child on a slide, even though previously excited, once they gain momentum, fear arises within their mind, and they hang on. In the same way, the meditator's mind, feeling the uncontrollable nature of entering the flow state that is the doorway to jhana, becomes tense with fear and clings to the sensory world.

### Unstable Samadhi

Unstable samadhi is overcome in this final stage in three parts:

1. Progressive clarity: Progressively increase the clarity of the Meditation Markers while samadhi develops in mindfulness of breathing. Be careful not to rush through each Marker, instead develop stability in it by allowing each Marker to reveal itself naturally.

2. Finding Enjoyment: To find enjoyment in the simplicity experienced within each Marker, it is essential to adopt the correct mental attitude when you sit down to meditate. Not one that is based on striving or expectation, but rather one of finding enjoyment and contentment with the simplicity of meditation itself. This can be enhanced by gently smiling with your eyes into how nice your present experience feels.

3. Softening effort (letting go): Learn to transition through the Markers by finding enjoyment of the natural unfolding of mindfulness of breathing by softening and letting go rather than by 'doing' your meditation.

## Insight

- Marker: 12 - Access Concentration
- Hindrance: 12 - Fear of Letting Go
- Antidote: Developing saddha: faith, confidence, and trust in the Buddha, your teacher, and your meditation community is the key to letting go (vosagga). Develop trust in the Buddha, your teacher, your community and the Dhamma. A helpful reflection is: "I am not the first to walk this path; others have walked it before me". Mature the depth of your contentment in seated meditation and all aspects of life. Repeat your exposure to the growing blissful, pleasant feeling until your mind develops disenchantment towards it so that all anticipation and fear drops away.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "Am I curious about completely calming 'all doing' in my mind to create the conditions for access concentration?"

### Learnings

- Insight is developed at this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about completely calming 'all doing' in your mind to create the conditions for Marker 12: Access Concentration, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 12: Fear of Letting Go.

### Six Characteristics of Access Concentration

1. There will be an initial pleasant feeling or tingling in your body and mind. The first sign of the conditions for access concentration starting to develop is that your mind will no longer wander from your meditation object, and you will begin to feel a feeling of pleasantness growing in your body and mind (piti) around Skill 09. Piti arises as the mind begins to enjoy being secluded from sensory stimulation and the hindrances. Initially, you may experience piti as a pleasant sensation in your forehead, face, chest, or hands. Some meditators feel it in their legs or spine as an upward-moving, pleasurable energy.

2. Your mind will have no interest in sensory pleasure. The second sign of the conditions for access concentration developing is that your mind will no longer have any interest in experiencing anything other than your meditation object, and it will incline toward the pleasure and enjoyment of letting go. As your mind inclines away from sensory experience, the sensations in your body and the borders of your body will completely fade away. All that will remain is the experience of pleasant piti within your awareness, with the happiness of sukha and an awareness of sound being far away in the background.

3. There will be no hindrances present within your mind. The third sign is that your samadhi (unification or collectedness of mind) will be strong enough to suppress all hindrances from your mind. This means that your mind becomes so unified and intimate with your meditative experience that there is no room within it for any hindrance to be present. The presence of thinking in the background, anticipation, fear of letting go or doubt are signs that your samadhi is not yet stable enough to suppress the hindrances.

4. Your mind will switch from applied to sustained attention. The fourth sign is the effort of focus your attention (vitakka) on your meditation object dropping away. A sign that effort has dropped away is that keeping your meditation object in mind becomes effortless and autonomous (vicara) as your mind takes over the application of awareness (vitakka) to your meditation object, itself.

5. Your attention and awareness will feel unified, steady and firm. The fifth sign of access concentration developing is when the previous conditions come together as your samadhi matures, and awareness and attention merge as one. This is experienced as your awareness becoming steady, firm, effortless, unmoving, and free from distraction and hindrances, like looking through a still, clean glass window.

6. There will be an absence of any desire 'to do' or 'doer' within your mind. The sixth sign is that, after samadhi has matured, there will be no longer a desire 'to do' and a complete absence of a 'doer', making the unification of the samadhi feel effortless and desireless. You will no longer feel like you are 'doing' your attention or awareness, and your mind will begin to flow with the experience of a pleasurable feeling of piti that arises within the awareness of your body and mind.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress when you are comfortable developing access concentration and can remain in it for at least 15 minutes with the pleasant feeling of piti remaining stable within the awareness of your body without fading. Congratulations, you have finished Cultivation 04.
