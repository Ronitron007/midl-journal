# Skill 04: Content Presence

Cultivation: 02 - Mindfulness of Breathing
Subtitle: How to transform habitual forgetting into present contentment & happiness
Duration: 30 minutes

> "When experiencing delusion within their mind, the meditator knows: 'there is delusion present within my mind'. When there is no delusion present within their mind, the meditator knows: 'There is no delusion present within my mind'." — The Buddha, MN 10

## Overview

As a growing contentment with the presence of your body develops, you will naturally begin to enjoy it. You will then gently smile toward it with your eyes to align your mind with the enjoyment of your meditation, and to allow contentment with your meditation to grow, weakening habitual forgetting.

## Benefits

- Teaches you how to find enjoyment in contentment and enjoy simple things in life

## Purpose

Train your mind to recognise the pleasant spiritual feeling available in letting go and to create the conditions for initial meditative joy by developing contentment to shorten the time your mind is lost in habitually forgetting your meditation.

## Instructions

Your meditation is the same as Meditation Skill 03, except that you now focus on cultivating a feeling of contentment with your meditation by enjoying the nice feeling of being mindful and present in your body as developed in Skill 03. Finding enjoyment with the contentment of the simple experience of your body resting in meditation will weaken the hindrances of forgetting and mind wandering.

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-03

Develop Mindful Presence in your body as you did in Skills 01-03. Once you feel very present in your body, begin to find contentment and enjoyment in the simple act of resting mindfully in meditation by adding Steps 2-4.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being present in your body.

Additions for developing contentment and happiness in Skill 04:

### Step 2: Enjoy Contentment

Enjoy how nice it feels to be mindfully present in your body. Use a few softening breaths to gently relax any interest in past or future that comes up in your mind.

### Step 3: Smile with Your Eyes

Smile with your eyes, radiating kindness and care to connect your heart to your meditation. Just like you would smile at a loved one or a friend to let them know how much you care. Then smile toward the experience of contentment and presence in your body, allowing it to grow into an overall feeling of contentment and enjoyment.

### Step 4: Apply the GOSS Formula

To develop insight, become interested in distraction and apply the GOSS Formula anytime you observe that you have forgotten your meditation. During this stage of meditation, the main hindrance you want to weaken is the length of time you forget that you are meditating when your mind wanders to thoughts, etc. Applying the GOSS Formula and enjoying returning to the presence of your body, finding contentment in it will reward your mind for returning to mindful presence, weakening habitual mind wandering and forgetting.

GOSS Formula: How to Let Go.
- Ground.
- Observe.
- Soften.
- Smile.
- Repeat if needed.

Ground = Be mindful of the touch of your thumbs.
Observe = Enjoy noticing when you have been lost in thoughts or memories and forgot that you were meditating to create a positive reward for returning to mindfulness.
Soften = Return awareness to your body by softening/relaxing your body and mind.
Smile = Smile with your eyes, enjoying how nice it feels to let go of distraction and complexity to reward your mind letting go.

## Tips

- As your body and mind continue to relax and mental noise settles down, there will be times when you will feel breathing within your body. The appearance of the experience of breathing is a sign that relaxation is transitioning into calmness, and your sensitivity to these subtle bodily movements is increasing. It is essential not to bring your attention to your breathing and focus on it, as this may cause your mind to try to control it, leading to changes in your breathing patterns. Instead, continue to relax back into your body and enjoy your meditation. When your mind is ready to progress to Meditation Skill 05, you will find that your body begins to sense breathing by itself.
- Smiling with the eyes can be seen in the way people naturally smile toward a newborn baby, their child, intimate partner or friend. It is a heartfelt smile that comes from the heart, not from the mouth. We can observe ourselves or others smile in this way; their eyelids relax, and a feeling of care and happiness comes from the inside, sent out through their eyes. As they do this, they look the other person in the eyes, conveying to them that they care and want to connect.

## Obstacles

### Feeling Stuck on Finding Enjoyment

Are you feeling stuck on this meditation? I will start by saying that what you are experiencing in your meditation, though difficult, is exactly what is meant to be happening. The ebb and flow of enjoyment in meditation is a normal part of developing an insight meditation practice.

In MIDL, there are four rites of passage that meditators often feel stuck on:
1. Skill 04 with enjoyment and pleasure.
2. Skill 07 with gross dullness.
3. Skill 09 with becoming too tranquil.
4. Skill 12 with anticipation and fear and Stream Entry with attachment to ownership, control and doubt.

I use the word rite-of-passage because once we understand the lesson found within them deeply enough, they no longer come up again. We feel stuck in each of these areas because they are the places where we can achieve the highest results in reducing dukkha (suffering) when we develop deep enough insight into them in our daily lives.

In life, when we are interested in something, we find enjoyment in it, and when we find enjoyment in it, we become curious about it. People can find enjoyment, curiosity and the pleasure of enjoying something in anything. My mother found enjoyment and pleasure in collecting spoons. I didn't, but she did. I found enjoyment in collecting stamps when I was young and hot-rodding cars when I was a teenager. My mother didn't, but I did. This is because interest, enjoyment and how nice it feels don't come from things in life but from our attitude toward them.

If we are trying to find enjoyment in something, there will be no enjoyment, and it won't feel nice. Why? Because in our trying, we are discontent with what is happening now, trying to get somewhere else other than where we are now. In that discontentment, we lose touch with reality, lose touch with what is happening now; we become adverse toward it. When we are filled with desire and aversion, and with desire and aversion toward what is happening now, how can enjoyment and the pleasure of enjoyment come up?

Interest, enjoyment, and a sense of well-being are not unique to meditation; they are a natural part of life. Since Meditation Skill 04 onwards, there has been a focus on finding enjoyment in our meditation by being interested in how nice it feels to relax and let go; it can reveal a tendency in our mind to not find enjoyment in other aspects of our life. I am not saying that this is true for you, but it revealed to me that my mind viewed most things in my life as serious and flawed and that I wasn't truly enjoying anything. Instead, I always focused on what was wrong rather than what was right.

Curiosity is the key here. Being actively curious about what it means to find enjoyment in relaxing and letting go, and anything that hinders our ability to relax and let go and find enjoyment in it will create the conditions for interest in your meditation to arise. Interest will create the conditions for enjoyment to arise. Enjoyment will create the conditions for pleasant feelings to emerge. The pleasant feelings will create the conditions for contentment and happiness to arise. This will make the conditions for a more curious and pleasurable feedback loop to be established.

We are learning that this feedback loop of curiosity, interest, and enjoyment also happens in daily life with ordinary, everyday things. The difference between everyday life and the meditation path is that enjoyment in daily life comes from acquiring something. In contrast, enjoyment on the meditation path comes from letting things be, from letting them go. I recommend this because it is natural for human beings to smile with or through their eyes when they are content, happy and enjoying what is happening now. People use this type of smile to connect, whether it be with friends, family, or intimate partners. When we smile with our eyes in a natural, unforced way, it connects our hearts and allows our minds to access the pleasant feeling of this natural, connected happiness.

If we, however, have difficulty connecting with other people or animals in this way, if we are more defensive and closed in the way we relate to life, then this smiling will not come naturally and may not evoke any pleasant feelings at all. And this is perfectly ok. When practising generating feelings of loving-kindness, we may find that it feels mechanical, and hardly any loving feeling comes up. It is essential to acknowledge and accept that this is where we are at this time if we want to move forward. We have come to meditation wanting to feel safer and more connected, and our meditation practice has revealed this weakness. Finding interest and enjoyment in life is available to all of us by paying attention with curiosity to the simple things in life and cultivating contentment in them.

This may not initially come easily to our minds; therefore, it is our starting point. How much will my life transform if I train my mind to find enjoyment in these simple things and to connect with life around me? Be patient and playful around this. This is an opportunity for real benefits from your meditation. Can you find enjoyment in your life? If so, then recall that this is how to bring the feeling up in meditation. Is enjoyment rare in life? This explains the weakness in accessing enjoyment in meditation. This is your doorway in. Be curious to find enjoyment in the simple act of relaxing your shoulders and start to build from there.

### Observing Anatta During Meditation

To observe anatta, notice how something happens by itself. Suppose I have a reference point (grounding point) for my present experience, such as mindfulness of my body. In that case, when my mind wanders, or I find myself thinking about something, I can clearly notice that the mind wandering or thinking happened by itself.

A short reflection when your mindfulness returns and you notice that you are distracted is helpful. This reflection can be as simple as noticing that there was a period in which you had no idea what was going on: "Well, that is interesting". You can use a simple word called a label to clarify this: "distracted" or quickly reflect on what it felt like to be distracted and what it feels like to be present in your body again (soften, smile).

While typing this takes a while, noticing anatta is very quick to do. Think of making a cake, and at some stage, you quickly reflect to recall what you have done so far. When you reflect, you can quickly see the steps and then continue to focus on what you are doing now in the baking process. In the same way, it doesn't take a lot of 'thinking about things' during meditation to clearly see that your attention wandered from your meditation object to a distraction by itself.

It just takes clear seeing and developed intimacy with the experience of your meditation object, in this case, how nice it feels to be mindfully present in your body. This familiarity with mindfulness of your body will allow you to notice when you become distracted from it more easily.

Looking again and again, clearly seeing what is present and how it is behaving, will gradually make your mind more sensitive to the 'by itself nature' of experiences that occur during meditation and in daily life. It does take a clear intention and curiosity to notice that things happen 'by themselves'. Once you start to see this, it is endlessly fascinating.

Should you tell yourself something like, 'Hey, that distraction was autonomous', add a label or something else? You can do that. Some meditators say anatta, or hey, that was interesting. Being curious about the points of change between attention, inattention, and the return of attention is enough. If I watch a cat walk across a room by itself several times, any feeling that I am the cat fades away. The cat does cat things by itself; therefore, I am not the cat and allow the cat to be a cat.

If I observe the experiences of my mind and body, I will clearly see that they are doing things on their own. If I am aware of these experiences repeatedly, like the cat, and notice that they are occurring independently, without my help, the feeling that I am my body, I am my mind, will naturally also start to fade (viraga). It becomes clear when looking with curiosity and noticing things happening on their own; that is the key.

## Insight

- Marker: 04 - Content Presence
- Hindrance: 04 - Habitual Forgetting
- Antidote: Cultivating enjoyment and contentment with your present experience during meditation is the antidote to Habitual Forgetting (Hindrance 04). Your goal is to take pleasure in being fully aware of your body, allowing you to notice whenever your mind begins to wander. By finding joy in recognizing when you have lost touch with your body and become absorbed in thought, you can shorten the duration of this forgetfulness and train your mind to return to mindfulness more quickly. Criticism, judgment, and negativity regarding your tendency to forget or let your mind wander will only reinforce this habit, making being present feel unpleasant. Instead, positive reinforcement through wholesome rewards is key. The time spent in distraction can be skillfully reduced by finding joy in the process of returning to mindfulness. By tuning into the pleasant feeling of coming back to the present and letting go of distractions, you encourage your mind to return more swiftly, gradually shortening the time spent lost in distraction. Smiling gently and embracing the pleasure of softening and letting go can connect your mind to this experience, enhancing the positive rewards for your mind. This, in turn, will help weaken the hindrance of habitual forgetting and foster a healthier pattern of increased presence within your body.

### Hindrance Description

You forget your meditation object and that you are meditating, becoming completely lost within the mind created world of thoughts, memories or fantasies for a period of time.

Habitual forgetting occurs when mindfulness weakens, causing you to lose focus on your meditation object and forget that you are meditating. After some time, you may realize that you have become absorbed in a stream of thoughts, memories, and fantasies. This tendency to forget is a survival mechanism of the mind, developed to conserve energy by following established patterns of behavior, much like a screensaver on a computer.

It's important to understand that habitual forgetting is a natural function of the mind, rather than a personal flaw. This mental habit can be gradually deconditioned through skillful retraining and practice.

### Working with the Hindrance

To weaken the mental habit of habitual forgetting, once you are familiar with Skills 01-03, you can apply them to support this process:
1. Sit in meditation with your palms resting in your lap, one thumb gently resting on the other. This creates a reference point from which you can observe your mind wandering away from this touch, helping you remember your meditation practice.
2. Develop enjoyment of Mindful Presence of your body as in Skills 01-04. Gently soften your mental effort so that your awareness of the touch of your thumbs goes slightly out of focus. This will loosen your mind's grip on that sensation and allow your attention to habitually wander so that you can observe it.
3. Mind Wandering: If you notice a thought, memory, or fantasy arise in your mind but don't become lost in it, there's no need to do anything with it. Simply acknowledge its presence as something that occurred on its own (anatta) and continue to enjoy the relaxation and presence of your body. If you feel a slight pull of interest toward a thought, memory, or fantasy, simply soften the effort of your mind to let go of this interest, as described in Skill 02.
4. Habitually Forgetting: If you find yourself completely absorbed in a thought, memory, or fantasy, recognize its anatta nature and smile, rewarding your mind for returning to mindfulness. Then, apply the last two steps in the GOSS Formula: Soften > Smile. This will help shift your awareness back to your body, highlighting how pleasant it feels to relax and let go of mental distractions. Focusing on how nice it feels to let go will reward your mind, resetting your mindfulness of your body.

Reestablish your attention on the touch of your thumbs as your reference point and begin again from Step 3.

### Progression Map

Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.

At this stage of mindfulness of breathing, insight is developed by being curious about creating the conditions that support Marker 04: Content Presence, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 04: Habitual Forgetting.

The mental habit of forgetting your meditation object and becoming lost within mind wandering will gradually weaken with increased intimacy with the enjoyment of breathing in Markers 04-06, and a weakened version may still be present until the transition onto Marker 07 with increased calm of body, breathing and mind.

Meditative Hindrances (Hindrances to calm) -> Meditation Markers (Signs of deepening calm)
- 00: -> Diaphragm Breathing
- 01: -> Body Relaxation
- 02: -> Mind Relaxation
- 03: -> Mindful Presence
- 04: Habitual Forgetting -> Content Presence [CURRENT SKILL]
- 05: Habitual Control -> Natural Breathing
- 06: Mind Wandering -> Whole of Each Breath
- 07: Gross Dullness -> Breath Sensations
- 08: Subtle Dullness -> One Point of Sensation
- 09: Subtle Wandering -> Sustained Attention
- 10: Sensory Stimulation -> Whole-Body Breathing
- 11: Anticipation of Pleasure -> Sustained Awareness
- 12: Fear of Letting Go -> Access Concentration

It is important to note that although your focus is on weakening the Hindrance: Habitual Forgetting at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the above Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How does your body reflect your state of mind right now?"

### Learnings

- Your body directly and truthfully reflects your state of mind in the same way a lake reflects, without judgment, the mountain, clouds and sky
- If you feel mentally happy, you will also feel happiness in your body as a feeling of lightness, comfort and calm energy
- If you feel mentally averse and angry, you will also feel anger in your body as a feeling of hotness, tightness, tension, and upward-moving energy
- Your current state of mind can be observed by your body's reaction to it in terms of its elemental qualities: warmth, coolness, heaviness, lightness, hardness, softness, etc., and the feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness that surrounds it
- Checking in and observing these helpful reflections in your body during your day will help you to clearly see how you are relating to what is happening in your life at this time, allowing you to soften, relax and let it go if it is based on desire or resistance

### Steps

1. Ground: Gently soften and relax your body and mind to bring awareness into your body until you feel grounded and mindfully present (as in Meditation Skill 03)
2. Observe: Check in during the day and notice if you have lost peripheral awareness of your body. If you have, you will find that your mind has become caught up in some thought, fantasy, reaction, etc.
3. Soften: Take a few softening breaths to relax your body. Be mindful of your awareness returning to your body when you relax, and notice how nice it feels to re-establish a background mindful presence
4. Smile: Gently smile with your eyes and bring it to the pleasant feeling of being mindful in your body's presence. For a few moments, smile and encourage the enjoyment of it to grow, rewarding your mind for letting go. Let go of this presence and go about your day, checking in now and then and softening and smiling to re-establish it if your mind has forgotten your body

Practised in this way, following the GOSS Formula, your mind will gradually develop a positive habit of being mindful of your body during the day. At first, the periods of peripheral mindful presence of your body will be short, but gradually, the periods of mindful presence will increase, and habitual patterns of desire and aversion will weaken.

### Daily Tips

- Use simple reminders: Use a simple reminder, such as walking through a doorway, washing your hands, or having a cup of tea, to check in on how you feel
- If you feel stressed: If you are resisting something, you will likely notice physical sensations within your body, such as tension and tightness in your throat, chest, or abdomen; there will also be a feeling of unpleasantness or unease in the background. Taking slow, softening breaths in your belly to relax, as you learned in Meditation Skills 01 & 02, will lower your experience of this stressed feeling
- If you feel anxious: When you feel anxious, ground your awareness by feeling your feet touching the ground. You can also ground by gently squeezing one hand in the other to make you more present. Next, place your palms below your belly button and use slow, softening breaths in your lower abdomen, as you did in the previous meditation, to re-engage your diaphragm. Re-engaging your diaphragm with slow, belly breaths will help lower anxious feelings
- To carry this presence throughout your day, allow your body's mindful presence to shift into peripheral awareness, much like you would enable quiet, gentle music to rest in the background of your awareness while you move about your home

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 05: Natural Breathing when you become naturally aware of the experience of your body breathing and find enjoyment in the relaxation and presence of your body. You will also notice that at this stage, the length of time you forget what you are doing during meditation and become lost in thinking will start to shorten. The appearance of the experience of your body breathing is the sign that your mind is ready for Skill 05. If the experience of your breathing is unclear at this stage, it is a sign that you need to spend more time learning to relax your body and mind. The quieter you become through relaxation, the more sensitive your body will become to your breathing. It is important to note that mind wandering and forgetting you are meditating for short periods is normal at this stage of meditation, will still be present at this time and will not fully settle down until the maturing of Skill 06. If you are feeling stuck and can't experience any pleasant feelings in your meditation in Skill 04, it is okay to move on to Skill 05. If your body feels present, and as you relax, you become aware of the movement of breathing in your body, it is okay to move on to Skill 05. Since all Skills are various stages of calm in meditation, you will still be practising Meditation Skill 04 each time you meditate and will gradually develop enjoyment in meditation anyway. Think of this approach as being stuck in the mud with a four-wheel drive. We could sit in the mud and dig away, or we could take a run-off and use that momentum to get to the other side. Removing the goal and finding enjoyment in meditation again will gradually bring back the pleasant feeling of meditation on its own.
