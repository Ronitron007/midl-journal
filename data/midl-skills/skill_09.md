## Instructions

### Your Meditation So Far

- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.
- Enjoy tranquility and intimacy with one point of sensations.

### Step 1: Mindful Presence

Develop Markers 01-03 purely by relaxing and letting go with a clear comprehension of the experience of it. This experience can be divided into three areas:
- The experience of elements in your body.
- The pleasantness of how nice it feels to relax and let go.
- The increased awareness of your body develops as you relax effort in your body and mind.

Meditate by relaxing and letting go to develop mindfulness and balanced effort.
- Develop your skill in transitioning between Markers 01-03: M01: Body Relaxation > M02: Mind Relaxation > M03: Mindful Presence by taking your time to clearly comprehend and enjoy the subtle pleasantness of relaxing and letting go.
- Observe how these three Markers establish the first three Awakening Factors of mindfulness, curiosity & balanced effort.

When you are comfortable developing Markers 01-03 by relaxing and letting go with a clear comprehension of the enjoyable experience of presence, you can include Step 2.

### Step 2: Content Presence

Meditate by relaxing and letting go to develop contentment and meditative joy.
- Develop your skill in transitioning from Marker 03-04: M03: Mindful Presence > M04: Content Presence by taking your time to clearly comprehend and enjoy how nice it feels to be content and to abide mindfully in your body.
- Observe how developing contentment in Marker 04: Content Presence begins to establish the fourth Awakening Factor of Meditative Joy by uplifting your mind with the spiritual pleasant feeling that comes from feeling content and satisfied.

When you are comfortable developing Markers 01-04 by relaxing and letting go with a clear comprehension of the enjoyable experience of contentment, you can include Step 3.

### Step 3: Calm Abiding

Meditate only by relaxing & letting go to develop calm abiding.
- Develop your skill in transitioning from Marker 05-07: M05: Natural Breathing > M06: Whole of Each Breath > M07: Breath Sensation by taking your time to clearly comprehend and enjoy the subtle pleasantness of growing calm within your body, breathing and mind.
- Observe how, as calm develops, it also calms the fourth Awakening Factor: Meditative Joy, as the conditions for the fifth Awakening Factor: Tranquillity develop.

When you are comfortable developing Markers 01-07 by relaxing and letting go with a clear comprehension of the enjoyable experience of calm, you can include Step 4.

### Step 4: Tranquillity & Seclusion

Meditate by relaxing and letting go to develop meditative joy and tranquillity.
- Develop your skill in transitioning from Marker 07-08: M07: Breath Sensation > M08: One Point of Breath Sensation by taking your time to clearly comprehend and enjoy the subtle pleasantness of growing tranquillity & seclusion.
- To do this, gently smile into the pleasantness of growing tranquillity & seclusion while clearly comprehending the changing elemental qualities within the breath sensation. (You can replace breath with the touch of your thumbs if preferred). Enjoy the subtle pleasant feeling of the growing tranquillity while calming any desire 'to do' your attention. Gradually, the focus of your attention will stabilise on the one point of breath sensation.

### Step 5: Increase Stability

Continue gently softening your mental effort to calm all 'doing' within your mind. As your mind continues to calm by finding enjoyment in the growing tranquillity and seclusion, your attention will become effortlessly stable on one point of breath sensation. When effortless stability occurs, maintain silent, stable attention on one point of breath sensation.

### Step 6: Sustained Attention

When your attention becomes very stable, it no longer flickers to thoughts or other sensory experiences. Allow your attention to rest on that one point and perceive the beauty & subtle pleasantness in the experience of growing tranquillity.

As the stability of your attention matures, it will sustain the breath-sensation and stay there by itself. This is experienced as a shift from effort to effortlessness. This shift is very distinct. Sustained means that attention effortlessly, by itself, rests on one point of breath sensation at the tip of your nose, while maintaining a 20% peripheral awareness of your whole-body breathing. Peripheral awareness is like music playing in the background at a dinner party, enjoying it but not focusing on it.

## Tips

- Meditate only by Letting Go: At this stage of meditation, it is essential to learn how to transition between Markers 01-09 in mindfulness of breathing, not by 'doing' each Marker, but rather by allowing them to arise as a natural progression of relaxation and letting go, with clear comprehension. As you relax and let go, take an interest in how the development of Markers 01-09 establishes the first Five Awakening Factors: mindfulness, curiosity, balanced effort, meditative joy, & tranquillity.
- At this stage of meditative skill, your mind will naturally begin to move between Markers quickly due to the momentum of letting go in your heart and mind. This transition can be so fast that you may not notice all of the markers. It is essential to follow the momentum of letting go that is present within your heart and mind. For example, you may move straight into Marker 03: Mindful Presence as soon as you sit in meditation. You may then move from there to sensations at the tip of your nose in Marker 07. Next, you find that your mind no longer wanders, and your attention sustains on one point at Marker 09: Sustained Attention. Skipping over Markers without effort is a natural sign of the mind's progression toward samatha as the hindrances weaken.
- For some meditators, as samadhi develops, the clarity of experiencing sensations in their breathing may start to fade and even disappear. This is not due to subtle dullness as in Skill 08 but rather because of the increased unification of samadhi. If your attention is no longer wandering and your breath sensation disappears, keep your attention resting on that one point. As you do your breathing pattern will shift into effortlessness, and the breath-sensation will reappear. If it doesn't and your attention is no longer wandering, opening your awareness to your whole-body breathing, as in Skill 10, will re-establish the experience of breath sensation throughout your body. As long as your attention is freed from habitual wandering and your intellectual mind has calmed down, you have achieved the purpose of Skill 09.

## Obstacles

### Mental Dryness Due to Too Much Tranquillity

A rite of passage for many meditators at this stage of mindfulness of breathing is entering into a very still, calm state of mind that is exceptionally peaceful, with nothing happening. In this state, the experience of your body and breathing will fade, as well as your ability to access the joyful feeling of piti-sukha. If you have experienced this at Skill 09, you have entered into mental dryness due to too much tranquillity.

Try developing devotion toward the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, and carry that devotion into your mindfulness of breathing. This devotion, saddha (verified faith), will create the conditions for meditative joy and, therefore, piti-sukha to arise and allow it to continue through the whole of your meditation. The absence of the Awakening Factor of piti-sukha will prevent you from progressing to Meditation Skills 10-12.

The first thing to acknowledge when you find yourself caught in dry tranquillity is that this tranquil state is positive in terms of the Awakening Factors. The problem isn't the tranquillity; it is that your tranquillity is high, which is a good thing. However, everything creates causes and conditions, including the overdevelopment of tranquillity. Just as earlier-developed relaxation and calm meditators can end up in dullness due to over-calming their knowing ability when developing tranquillity, meditators can over-calm meditative joy and enjoyment. As tranquillity develops, it calms the intellectual functions of the mind, including the function of interest and caring toward what is being experienced. This removes the conditions for meditative pleasure and the ability to find enjoyment, causing both of these to fade from your mind gradually.

The trick is to uplift your mind with meditative pleasure and enjoyment while calming the intellectual functions of your mind. This can be done by:
- Enjoyment: Making the enjoyment of your meditation stronger before developing tranquillity in Skills 08-09, by intentionally finding enjoyment in the growing seclusion of calm and tranquillity. Be curious about and make a firm intention to enjoy the pleasure of relaxing and letting go of the sensory world.
- Saddha: Try developing strong devotion toward the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha and carrying that devotion into your mindfulness of breathing.
- Loving-Kindness: Try switching to metta, loving-kindness, as your main practice for a time, until joy becomes strong and stable.
- Gratitude: Bring more gratitude into your meditation and life by intentionally bringing your awareness to what is right about this present experience rather then what is wrong.

## Insight

- Marker: 09 - Sustained Attention
- Hindrance: 09 - Subtle Wandering
- Antidote: Developing your skill in cultivating effortless and stable attention in Marker 09, is the antidote for the Hindrance of Subtle Wandering. Developing your skill in accessing the enjoyment of letting go within each of the Markers by relaxing and developing intimacy with each one. It is important to note that the conditions for accessing spiritual pleasantness & enjoyment are dependent on your mind letting go. Every day, cycles of mental clinging based on feelings of attraction and aversion will affect your ability to sustain your attention. Curious observation and refinement of sila (morality), combined with taking it easy in daily life while reducing sensory stimulation and distraction, will make meditative joy more accessible during meditation.

Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.

Insight is developed at this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about creating conditions that support the stability of Marker 09: Sustained Attention at the tip of the nose, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 09: Subtle Wandering.

Subtle Wandering refers to the experience of little flickering movements of your attention away from your meditation object during meditation. Flickering of attention is observed at this stage because of deep relaxation and letting go of control. This is simply habitual scanning of your attention towards your six sense fields that occurs because you are no longer controlling your mind. When Subtle Wandering is present, you may have thoughts and other distractions arising in your peripheral awareness. Still, they do not draw the focus of your attention from your meditation object. As samadhi deepens, this flickering will naturally calm and come to an end for the period of the meditation by itself.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How can I use meditative joy to observe attraction and aversion in my daily life?"

Your understanding of accessing meditative joy can be applied to your daily life as a way of observing attraction and aversion, as the fading of joy occurs when these emotions are present. Since the factors of softness, meditative joy, and tranquillity are cultivated by tuning into the pleasantness of letting go, any habitual grasping of your mind throughout the day will cause this pleasure to collapse.

### Steps

1. Soften, relax and allow awareness to enter your body.
2. Allow this peripheral awareness to shift to the background.
3. Smile into and enjoy this mindful presence to arouse joy.
4. Develop sensitivity to meditative joy within your mind.
5. Use meditative joy to observe your mind during the day.
6. Gently smile with your eyes to re-establish it when it weakens.
7. Tune into the arising pleasant feeling of this return & letting go.
8. Smile into and encourage this joy to grow within your mind.

## Progression

Criteria: When your attention no longer wanders from your meditation object and effortlessly sustains (rests) on one point of breath sensation. There will still be sensory experiences and (might be) thoughts in the background, but they no longer draw your attention away from your meditation object. You will still have sensory experience within your peripheral awareness, including some fleeting thoughts, but your attention will no longer move out to them.
