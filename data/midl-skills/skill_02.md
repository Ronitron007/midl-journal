## Instructions

### Step 1: Meditation Skill 01

Sit for meditation and develop relaxation of your body in Meditation Skill 01.

Your Meditation So Far:

- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body.

### Step 2: Relax your mind with slow out-breaths

After relaxing your body in Skill 01, take five more breaths, but this time allow a slow breath out through your nose with each out-breath. Slowing the out-breath through the nose has a calming effect on the mind.

### Step 3: Relax your eyelids to relax your mind

Repeat with five more breaths, and increase the relaxation of your mind by allowing your eyelids to droop with each out-breath. Relaxing our eyelids signals the mind to relax and fall asleep. Relaxing our eyelids slowly and deliberately with clear comprehension helps to relax our mind without becoming dull and sleepy.

### Step 4: Enjoy the relaxation

Once you feel physically and mentally relaxed, allow your breathing to happen naturally for the rest of your meditation.

## Obstacles

### Sati Sampajañña (Mindfulness with Clear Comprehension)

Sati: Mindfulness = Keep in mind and remember the present experience.
Sampajañña: Clear Comprehension = tracking the conditional changes within present experience over time.

While it is the function of mindfulness to remember the present experience, it is the function of clear comprehension to track the process of conditioned change within the present experience over time.

## Insight

- Marker: 02 - Mind Relaxation
- Hindrance: 02 - Mental Restlessness
- Antidote: Developing your skill in relaxing your mind creates the conditions for Marker 02. To settle mental restlessness, be curious about what it means to relax effort in your mind. Take slow and gentle breaths out through your nose while focusing on the area of your frontal lobe. As you exhale, try to feel this area relaxing, and complement this by softening your eyelids.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How am I feeling now? Is my mind restless and inclining toward negativity?"

### Learnings

- To recognise mental restlessness
- To relax mental restlessness
- To appreciate how nice it feels to relax your mind & body
- To notice that whenever you relax your mind body, awareness of your body increases
