## Important Note

> The purpose of this course is to guide meditators interested in developing sutta-based Theravada Buddhist Insight Meditation within everyday household life. Once a meditator's mind has reached this level of insight, course-based instruction is no longer effective, and **in-person guidance with a skilled teacher or spiritual friend is more beneficial** for exploring deeper paths.
