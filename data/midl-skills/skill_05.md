# Skill 05: Natural Breathing

Cultivation: 02 - Mindfulness of Breathing
Subtitle: How to transform breath control into mindfulness of natural breathing
Duration: 30 minutes

> "Always mindful, they breathe in; mindful, they breathe out." — The Buddha, MN119

## Overview

As your body and mind relax, you will become aware of the gentle stretch and relaxation of your body as it naturally breathes. Finding enjoyment in the gentle stretch and relaxation of each breath as your body breathes will increase your mindfulness and teach your mind how to let go of control.

## Benefits

- This Meditation Skill will teach you how to be present with different experiences and situations within your life without the need to control them.

## Purpose

Train your mind to let go of breathing by finding the spiritual pleasantness of letting go, available in the natural flow of in- and out-breaths in your body to weaken any tendency of your mind to control your breathing.

## Instructions

Your meditation is the same as Meditation Skill 04, except you now develop mindfulness of the experience of breathing as it naturally flows in and out of your body. At this stage of meditation, it is important to bring the enjoyment and happiness you developed in Skill 04 to find the same enjoyment in the experience of your body as it breathes.

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-04

Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-04, except you now add Steps 2-3 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.

### Step 2: Natural Breathing

As the feeling of relaxation deepens, you will start to become aware of the subtle movement of your body as it breathes, as a gentle stretch and a natural relaxation.

Wherever breathing is clearest to you is ok. Your task is to learn to find enjoyment in the stretch and relaxation of your body as it naturally breathes. Relax back into the peripheral awareness of your body and notice how your body senses the gentle movement of breathing on its own.

### Step 3: Enjoy Your Breathing

Increase your awareness of how nice the stretch and relaxation of your body feels as your body breaths. Smile into your breathing with your eyes, finding enjoyment in the simplicity of each breath.

Smiling with your eyes, really enjoying it, will increase the pleasant feeling found within each in and out-breath. Finding enjoyment in your breathing will help to settle the hindrances of forgetting, control and mind wandering.

### Step 4: Developing Insight into Control

Develop insight by observing and softening any tendency of your mind to control your breathing. Breath control appears as tightness, tension, and breathing that does not settle or calm down as the meditation progresses. If you suspect breath control, allow a slow breath out through your nose, then relax and wait for the breath to draw back in by itself.

GOSS: Ground --> Observe --> Soften --> Smile.
- Ground: Be aware of the experience of your body's natural breathing.
- Observe: Notice whenever your mind begins to control your breathing.
- Soften: Allow a gentle softening breath out through your nose and relax and wait for it to come back in to reset your breathing.
- Smile: Smile with your eyes into the pleasantness as the natural breath draws in back in again, by itself, to reward your mind for letting go of control.

## Tips

- Develop insight by observing and softening any tendency of your mind to control your breathing. Breath control is characterised by tightness, tension, and breathing that does not settle or calm down as the meditation progresses. If you suspect breath control, allow a slow breath out through your nose, then relax and wait for the breath to draw back in by itself.
- It is important to note that although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Habitual Control at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance. As you develop contentment and enjoy your meditation more, you will become more aware of the natural flow of breathing throughout your body; old habits of seeking pleasure may slip in and manifest as your mind controls and tightens your breathing. Recognising your mind's tendency to control something that doesn't need to be controlled, your breathing presents a fantastic opportunity for insight into how to be aware of experiences and let them be as they are.

## Obstacles

### Habitual Control

Habitual Control refers to the experience of your mind interfering with and changing the natural flow of your breathing. Meditators usually experience this as a tight and uncomfortable feeling in the breath. This grasping of the mind to control the breath appears as tightness, tension and unease. As long as your mind has a habit of controlling your breath, your ability to develop deeper calm and tranquillity will be hindered. It is also important to observe your mind control things in daily life, as your breathing during mindfulness of breathing will reflect this. See this as an opportunity to learn to let go, and you are already halfway there.

## Insight

- Marker: 05 - Natural Breathing
- Hindrance: 05 - Habitual Control
- Antidote: Developing your skill in allowing your body to sense your breathing, rather then focussing your attention in on it creates the conditions for Marker 05, and is the antidote for the Hindrance of Habitual Control. To do this, be playful with finding the right amount of effort it takes to allow your breathing to occur naturally without controlling it. To learn to be with your breathing without control, first take a few soft, relaxing breaths and allow your awareness to return to your body. This will withdraw some of the energy from your mind by slightly shifting your attention out of focus. Next, let a slow, gentle out-breath through your nose. Once the breath has finished, then relax and wait. Trusting that your brain will fire a signal and that your body will begin breathing again by itself. When the breath comes back in, allow it to draw back in by itself. As you become comfortable with this, start to be curious about the difference in experience between breathing freely, without control, and controlled breathing. Repeating this and enjoying the natural, uncontrolled breath will gradually decondition your mind's tendency to control your breathing.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How am I relating to my breathing right now? Am I controlling it or allowing it to flow naturally?"

### Learnings

- Tightness and tension will appear in your body if your mind is resisting something.
- Feelings of longing will appear in your body if your mind wants something.
- Emotions and feelings of pleasantness and unpleasantness are also reflections of your state of mind in your body. It is helpful to observe these experiences in your body to understand how you relate to things in your life.
- These MIDL techniques you are learning naturally integrate into daily life. During quiet times, you can bring this simple skill of being mindful of your breathing into your daily life to relax your body and refresh your mind. From the foundation of mindfulness of your body, you can start to observe how the experience of your body changes throughout the day as a direct reflection of your state of mind.
- To avoid altering your breathing patterns or producing strain, be mindful of your breathing only during organised, quiet times and not striving to be mindful of your breath throughout the day. A more effective meditation object for achieving insight throughout your day is an open, peripheral awareness of your body, which creates a more present reference point.

### Steps

1. Gently soften awareness into your body until it feels grounded, present, now.
2. Relax and allow your awareness of your body to shift to the background.
3. During quiet time, learn to tune into the flow of breathing within your body.
4. Smile into the pleasant feeling of letting go that occurs with each natural breath.

## Support Teachings

### Mindfulness, Clear Comprehension and Delusion

When referring to the experience of delusion in MIDL, we are talking about the observation of habitual delusion. Habitual delusion can be observed during seated meditation and in daily life as the gaps of unawareness between attention and inattention. The experience of habitual delusion is very distinct and seen after it has occurred, as the mind slips into a state of not knowing and then defaults to underlying habitual patterns and tendencies autonomously.

While we are in habitual delusion, we cannot know it; this is because one of the primary conditions for it to arise is awareness of awareness ceasing. We can observe that this has happened when mindfulness returns, as awareness of awareness rearises again. It is at this point when you realise that you have been lost in thought or fantasy for a while and didn't realise it until now. On reflection, we can see that we were completely immersed in thought, fantasy, or memory, acting and reacting habitually and that we had no idea what was going on at that time.

There is an answer to this problem, and that is the development of samadhi (unification of mind/collectedness) built out of the Seven Awakening Factors:
1. Mindfulness.
2. Curiosity.
3. Balanced Effort.
4. Meditative Joy.
5. Tranquillity.
6. Unification of Mind.
7. Equanimity.

The minimum Awakening Factors that need to be present for samadhi to create a gap in habitual delusion are mindfulness and curiosity. Each Awakening Factor added to samadhi will make a bigger gap in delusion and habitual patterns within the insight meditator's mind.

As meditative samadhi develops and becomes more stable, not only do the periods of habitual delusion shorten, and the mindfulness gap increase, but mindfulness also returns more quickly during seated meditation and daily life. It is only then that we truly begin to see how much time throughout the day we spend in a habitually deluded state, with our mind autonomously practising habitual patterns and our personality by itself.

Habitual delusion and thinking do not necessarily go hand in hand, though, for most of us, some sort of thought process will be present in the deluded state. Delusion can also be present in the habituated doing of activities with no awareness of that doing. In defining habitual delusion, the key component is a period of 'not-knowing': the loss of awareness of awareness. You will experience this as sometimes exiting these states of unknowing and having the feeling that you weren't there for that period. You had checked out and went somewhere...

To weaken habitual delusion, it is essential to define the difference in experience between being in a state of not knowing versus the experience of being mindfully present within your body. The Buddha talked of this as being aware of the presence and absence of (X). When we talk about being aware of our present experience or the experience of what we are doing now, we have, at the very least, sati-sampajanna: mindfulness + clear comprehension.

To be mindful means to keep in mind to remember your present experience within short-term memory. The experience of mindfulness is being aware of being aware of (X) over time without losing awareness of it. Clear comprehension and mindfulness work together, and without clear comprehension, it is difficult for mindfulness to develop insight. The purpose of clear comprehension is to clearly see the intimate, conditional relationships in the flow of experience. Observing in this way, you will see a flow of autonomous (anatta) experiences within your awareness.

By observing the anatta nature of conditioned relationships within the gaps in habitual delusion created by samadhi, you will begin to understand the habitual nature of your mind and body. With this insight, your mind will gradually become disillusioned with delusion and begin to incline toward the undeluded state, which is the pleasant spiritual vedana found in samatha. Creating gaps in habitual delusion, developing insight in them, and coming back again and again to the pleasure of relaxing and letting go found in samatha, the periods of delusion will become less and of samatha will increase. The GOSS Formula in MIDL helps this process to unfold.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress when, as a natural progression of relaxing & letting go, you move from being aware of each in and out-breath to being aware of the whole length of each in and out-breath without controlling it. It is important to note that it is only necessary to weaken habitual control at this stage, not to be completely free from it. If your mind, for example, causes your breathing to tighten so that it is difficult to breathe, then habitual control needs to be weakened before moving on. However, if while being aware of the breath, your mind calms down, a sign of this is being aware of the whole length of each breath, then it is perfectly ok to move on to the next stage in your meditation.
