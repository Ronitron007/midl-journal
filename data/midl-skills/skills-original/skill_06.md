Meditation Skill 06
Cultivation: MINDFULNESS OF BREATHING
Name: Whole Of Each Breath
Subtitle: How to transform mind wandering into present breath awareness.

Quote: "Breathing in long, they know: 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, they know: 'I am breathing out long." The Buddha, MN119.

Overview:
As you enjoy the gentle stretch and relaxation of your body with each in and out-breath, your mind will develop intimacy with it. With this intimacy, the continuity of your mindful awareness will increase, allowing you to enjoy noticing the whole length of each in and out-breath.

Duration:
Meditation Length: 40 minutes. Due to the increased time it takes to settle the mind at this stage of meditation, increase your meditation time by 10 minutes.

Benefits:
This Meditation Skill will teach you how to improve your focus on your present task in daily life, with the added benefit of reducing mind wandering throughout the day as you become more present in your body.

Purpose:
Increase mindfulness and clear comprehension of the whole of each in- and out-breath as it naturally flows in your body, to shorten forgetting and mind wandering.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-05.
Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-05, except you now add Steps 2-3 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:

- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy your body as it breathes.

Additions for developing the Whole of Each Breath in Skill 06:

Step 2: Whole Length of each Breath.
As relaxation and enjoyment deepen, mindfulness of breathing will naturally transition from being aware of each in and out-breath in Skill 05 to being aware of the whole length of each breath, from its beginning to its middle to its end. This transition should not be forced but rather a natural progression of increased enjoyment and mindful curiosity.
To aid with this, I have found it helpful to picture each in and out-breath as one continuous breath that changes direction by not focusing on the gap between breaths.

Step 3: Continue to Enjoy Your Breathing.
As in Skill 06, increase your awareness of how nice each stretch and relaxation of your body feels. Smile into your breathing with your eyes, finding enjoyment in its simplicity.
Smiling with your eyes, really enjoying it, will increase the pleasant feeling found within each in and out-breath. Finding enjoyment in your breathing will help to settle the hindrances of forgetting, control and mind wandering.

Tip: As your samadhi deepens, it is essential to remain mindful of not becoming too mentally calm and allowing your awareness to become dull and unclear. Smiling with your eyes and bringing that smile to the subtle, pleasant feeling of each breath, really enjoying it, will keep Hindrance 07: Gross Dullness away.

Develop Insight into Mind Wandering and the beginnings of Gross Dullness.

Mind Wandering: Take advantage of any wandering of your attention away from this grounding point to cultivate your perception of the autonomous, 'by itself' nature (anatta) of mind wandering. Apply the GOSS Formula below to train your mind to find more enjoyment in your meditation than in wandering thoughts or fantasies.
Dullness: Also, be attentive to any feelings of dullness growing in your peripheral awareness as your mind becomes more intimate with the experience of the whole length of each breath. At this stage of developing samadhi, it is easy to over calm the mind's ability to comprehend an experience clearly.

Adjust Your GOSS Formula

At this stage of meditation, make a simple adjustment to your GOSS Formula to weaken distraction.

GOSS Formula: Ground --> Observe --> Soften --> Smile.

Ground: Be aware of the experience of the whole length of each breath.
Observe: Notice whenever you become distracted from it.
Soften: With gentle breaths, relax and become aware of the whole of each breath.
Smile: Smile with your eyes, noticing how nice it feels to be present again to reward your mind for returning to the presence of your breathing.

Insight Section:

Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.

Insight: Insight is developed at this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about creating conditions that support mindfulness of Marker 06: Whole of Each Breath, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 06: Mind Wandering.

Meditative Hindrance: Mind Wandering (06).
Your mind finds distraction more enjoyable than your meditation object.

Mind Wandering refers to your mind seeking something more entertaining than your meditation object. When this happens, your mind shifts a thought, memory, or fantasy to the foreground of your attention, and your meditation object, in this case, the breath, rests in the background awareness. If you do not maintain this awareness, your mind will become distracted and drop your meditation object from awareness, slipping back down to Hindrance 04: Habitual Forgetting.

This is the normal progression of Mind Wandering in mindfulness of breathing:

Skills 00-03: Forgetting for long periods before mindfulness returns and being completely lost in mind-wandering is normal.
Skill 04: The length of time you forget you are meditating and become lost in mind-wandering before mindfulness returns becomes shorter as Skill 04 matures.
Skill 05: The length of time you forget you are meditating and become lost in mind-wandering before mindfulness returns continues to shorten as Skill 05 matures.
Skill 06: The length of time you forget your body breathing during meditation continues to shorten until it ends with the maturity of Skill 06. On maturity, there are periods of mind wandering without forgetting, and your breathing remains in your awareness without forgetting it. Note: mind wandering will still be present but the time distracted by it is shortening.
Skill 07-08: Because of the growing calm and calming of the intellectual mind, mind wandering occurs for short periods before awareness returns to breath sensation. During mind wandering at this stage, the breath sensations remain within your peripheral awareness and are not forgotten; you are simply partially distracted by them.
Skill 09: As Skill 09 matures, mind wandering changes to flickering of attention toward thoughts, then background thoughts, then a mind free from thoughts as attention sustains on breath sensation.

Antidote:
Developing your skill in cultivating intimacy with and enjoyment of your body breathing, to create the conditions for Marker 06, is the antidote for the Hindrance of Mind Wandering. In dealing with the wandering of your mind, sometimes you will find that your mind wanders to thoughts, memories, or fantasies that are very sticky in nature. This means that your mind has difficulty letting them go. These are opportunities for deeper insight. Sticky thoughts, memories and fantasies weaken by observing responses within your body, such as tensing or emotions, until you can experience the underlying pleasantness or unpleasantness. Applying the GOSS Formula by softening and relaxing the effort held within your mind and body toward these distractions while finding enjoyment in letting them go re-grounds awareness within your body and rewards your mind for letting them go.

Tip: It is important to note that although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Mind Wandering at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the above Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance. As you develop intimacy with each in- and out-breath, your mind will begin to enjoy your breathing, just as it did with Mindful Presence. As enjoyment with breath experience grows, your mind will become increasingly interested in the whole of each breath, from its beginning to the middle to the end. At this stage of meditation, it is essential to find enjoyment in the experience of your breathing. If you are not enjoying being mindful of each breath, your mind will replace it with something enjoyable, like thinking or fantasising. If this continues to go unnoticed, your mind will then slip back to Hindrance 04: Habitual Forgetting, causing your samadhi (unification of mind/collectedness) that you have developed so far to collapse.

Daily Application:

Meditation Skill 06 in Daily Life:

- Gently soften awareness into your body until it feels grounded, present, now.
- Relax and allow your awareness of your body to shift to the background.
- During quiet time, learn to tune into the flow of breathing within your body.
- Become aware of the whole length of each breath as it passes one point within your body.
- Feel the subtle pleasantness of each letting go that occurs with each natural breath.

Tip: To avoid altering your breathing patterns or producing strain, I recommend being mindful of your breathing only during organised quiet times, and not striving to be mindful of the breath throughout the day. A more effective meditation object for achieving insight throughout your day is an open, background awareness of your body, which creates a more present reference point.

Progression Criteria:

You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 07: Breath Sensations when:

- You find enjoyment in being aware of the whole length of each breath in & out-breath, without effort and without habitually forgetting your meditation object (the breath) and feel confident in your ability to settle any mind wandering by applying the GOSS Formula when it occurs.

Tip: Mind wandering does not completely stop at this stage of meditation and will continue in more subtle forms until Skill 09 when your attention sustains. As your mind and body relax and mindfulness develops, the time your mind wanders will shorten. It is how quickly you notice that your mind has wandered from your breath and body, and mindfulness returns that is most important here. For more information on this process, see the write-up in the Hindrances section: "Insight into Mind Wandering," above.

Support Teachings:

Progress of Insight in MIDL:
During this stage of Insight Meditation, the question usually arises about how to track the progress of insight in your meditation practice.

Relationship is important: The first thing to understand is that MIDL does not track experiences that occur during meditation or in daily life; it tracks the meditator's mind's relationship toward those experiences. These are known as the Five Relationships:

- Desire.
- Aversion.
- Indifference.
- Contentment.
- Equanimity.

These relationships directly correlate to the strengthening and weakening of the akusala (unwholesome/unskilful) and the kusala (wholesome/skilful).

Progress of insight develops by:

- Weakening the akusala (unwholesome/unskilful) in seated meditation and daily life.
- Developing the kusala (wholesome/skilful) in seated meditation and daily life.

Progress can be seen in seated meditation and daily life as:

- Hindrances to calm (akusala) becoming weaker.
- Relaxation, calm, presence, wholesome qualities (kusala) are becoming stronger.

This 4-step model tracks the progress of Insight in MIDL:

- Calming: When a hindrance arises in seated meditation and daily life, you understand how to change the conditions that support that particular hindrance, so that it weakens and you access samatha, or relaxation and calm.
- Fading: When a particular hindrance arises, it is not as strong as it used to be in seated meditation and daily life because your mind changes the conditions that support it and returns to samatha, by itself. This is akin to the fading of dye in a shirt after multiple washes.
- Non-arising: When the external conditions in seated meditation or daily life are right for a particular hindrance to arise, and it no longer arises. This is experienced as a feeling of absence and occurs because the mind and body naturally rest in a samatha state, and the internal conditions for the hindrance can no longer arise. At this level of insight, we have to be careful not to delude ourselves and rest in apathy or indifference.
- Uprooting: When the supportive conditions for a particular hindrance or set of hindrances have been removed due to Nibannic insight. This can only occur four times: Sotapanna, Sakadagami, Anagami, and Arahant, and progression can be observed in the Buddha's 10-Fetter Model.

Samadhi (unification of mind) is also anatta (autonomous).
When developing samadhi to establish access concentration, it is essential to take into account anatta (autonomous nature): you are not in control of your mind. It is necessary to understand this.

Many meditators' attention develops in this way, as a series of progressions and collapses. One day, you will feel like you have got it, that you now understand the path to unification. And the next day, your attention has collapsed, and you feel like you have no understanding of how to meditate. If this sounds like you, it is essential to understand that all of this is normal and all of this is how it should be.

The path that unfolds for you is not necessarily the same as it will for someone else; it is all based on previous conditioning. You have come to meditation with unique conditioned tendencies; it is these that govern how the meditative path unfolds for you. It is essential not to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others. Instead, observe your mind and allow it to reveal to you the correct path of development to take.

What is essential is not to try to control your mind but rather to develop an understanding of the conditions that make it the way that it is.

"When this is, that is.
When this is not, that is not.
With the arising of this comes the arising of that.
With the ceasing of this comes the ceasing of that."

If your samadhi is not developing and your mind will not let go of the meditative hindrances, then it is this way because the conditions are right for it to be that way. There are Six Awakening Factors present in the mind at access concentration; look at the conditions they need to arise and establish:

- Mindfulness.
- Curiosity.
- Balanced Effort.
- Meditative Joy.
- Tranquillity.
- Unification.

Do these six factors describe your meditative attention?
