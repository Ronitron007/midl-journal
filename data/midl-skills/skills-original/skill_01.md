MEDITATION INSTRUCTIONS:

What Meditation Skill 01 looks like:

- Sit in meditation.
- To develop mindfulness: Listen to the flow of sounds. Feel your clothing on your body.
- To relax your body: Relax with slow diaphragmatic (belly) breaths. Relax with slow, full-body breaths.
- For the rest of the meditation: Enjoy the relaxation of your whole body.

Step 1: Preparation for meditation
In this meditation, you move from lying down in Skill 00 to sitting upright with your legs crossed on a cushion on the floor, on a kneeling stool, or resting on a comfortable, supportive chair.

- Sit in meditation: Sit in meditation with one palm resting in the other, and feel the awareness of your whole body as you sit in meditation. You will be using awareness of your body as the meditation object.

Step 2: Develop mindfulness
Mindfulness is the meditative skill of gently remembering (keeping in mind) what you are experiencing now in your body, mind and senses.

- Listen to the flow of sound: Actively listen to sounds around you, the way they flow and change. Allow the presence of sound to develop mindfulness by gently keeping it in mind.
- Feel your clothing on your body: As you relax, you will naturally become aware of your clothing touching your body and the coolness/warmth of air touching your skin.
  Tip: Tune into how nice it feels to be present with these simple experiences: this is the key to deepening meditation.

Step 3: Relax your body with slow breaths
In MIDL, these slow, relaxing breaths are known as softening breaths because your body and mind become softer as you relax.

- Relax with diaphragmatic (belly) breaths: Take five softening breaths by slowly moving your belly outward and then slowly lowering it back.
- Relax with full-body breaths: Take five more slow inhales, starting in your belly, bringing the breath up to fill your chest, and then, with each exhale, allow your whole body to relax.

Step 4: Enjoy the relaxation
After taking these softening breaths, allow your breathing to return to its natural rhythm; enjoy the growing relaxation and comfort in your body for the rest of the meditation.

INSIGHT INTO PHYSICAL RESTLESSNESS:

Insight: Insight is developed in this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about creating the conditions that support Marker 01: Body Relaxation to weaken the conditions that support Hindrance 01: Physical Restlessness.

Meditative Hindrance: Physical Restlessness (01)
Unable to experience physical comfort.
Physical Restlessness refers to feeling of being unsettled in your body, which prompts you to move around and fidget. It occurs during meditation due to the build-up of energy from stress, aversion, or overstimulation in our daily lives.

Antidote: Developing your skill in relaxing your body creates the conditions for Marker 01. To settle physical restlessness, cultivate curiosity in finding enjoyment as you relax your body with slow, diaphragmatic, belly breaths. As you exhale, allow a part of your body, such as your shoulders, to relax slowly and deliberately so that you can feel the bodily relaxation.

DAILY APPLICATION:

The MIDL techniques you are learning will naturally integrate into your daily life. The Buddha recommended kaya-gata sati: mindfulness immersed within the body.

Check in during the day to see if you are holding too much effort in your body. Whenever you notice you are tensing up in your body, take a few slow belly breaths to allow your body to relax.

In Skill 01, you will learn four things for daily life:

1. To recognise physical restlessness.
2. To relax physical restlessness.
3. To appreciate how nice it feels to relax your body.
4. To notice that whenever you relax your body, awareness of your body increases.

How to do it:

- Enjoy noticing when you've forgotten to be mindful.
- Take a few breaths to relax your body when you notice.
- Finding enjoyment in the relaxing breaths.
- Clearly comprehending awareness returning to your body as you do.
- Being satisfied with creating small gaps in mind wandering.

PROGRESSION CRITERIA:
You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 02: Mind Relaxation when you experience periods of feeling relaxed and comfortable during your meditation, and you understand how to settle physical restlessness with slow, softening belly breaths.
