Meditation Skill 08
Cultivation: CALM & TRANQUILLITY
Name: One Point of Sensation
Subtitle: How to transform subtle dullness into tranquil clarity of sensation.

Quote: "The meditator knows how the arising of un-arisen tranquillity as an awakening factor comes to be and how, once arisen, tranquillity as an awakening factor reaches maturity through cultivation." The Buddha, MN10.

Overview:
While smiling, allow the growing feeling of pleasantness, joy, and tranquillity to unfold. Your mind will become deeply calm, and attention will naturally rest on a single point of breath sensation, clearly aware of sensations at that point while maintaining peripheral awareness of your whole body.

Duration:
Meditation Length: 45 minutes.

Benefits:
This Meditation Skill will teach you how to bring stability and calm to your mind, as well as the ability to shift your attention from habitual negativity to positive, wholesome qualities during your day. Allowing you to be able to direct your mind toward developing qualities that are of benefit, like love, kindness, gratitude, generosity, etc.

Purpose:
Calm the intellectual functions of your mind and remove subtle dullness by relaxing the perception of time and increasing the clarity of breath sensation.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-07.
Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-07, except you now add Steps 2-3 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:

- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.
- Enjoy growing calm and intimacy with breath sensations.

Additions for developing mindfulness of one point of breath sensation in Skill 08:

Step 2: One-point breath sensation.
As your perception of time fades in Marker 07, your awareness of breathing happening over time will fade, leaving one point of changing breath sensation at the tip of your nose. It is important not to try to make this happen but rather to fade your mind's interest in time by really enjoying what is happening now.
When your attention rests on one point of breath sensation, tune into the changing flow of those sensations at that one point while keeping a 30% awareness of the subtle movement of your body breathing in the background. This will prevent subtle dullness from developing.

Step 3: Increasing feeling of tranquillity.
As the seclusion of your mind increases due to low sensory stimulation, the experience of calm will grow into tranquillity as an open, unmoving stillness.
Gently smile with your eyes and bring that smile to the pleasant feeling of the growing tranquillity, allowing it to fill your background awareness while maintaining your attention on the changing sensation at the tip of your nose.

Tip: As you develop intimacy with the sensation within the length of each breath at the tip of your nose, the experience of calm and tranquillity of your mind will grow. Due to increasing calm and tranquillity, your mind's perception of time will begin to fade, and so will your perception of the length of each breath. This is experienced as attention becomes steady and firm on the one point of breath sensation. Due to increasing tranquillity, it is easy for curiosity to become too low, causing mindfulness to weaken. This can be observed as an increased clarity of mind, yet a loss of clarity of the sensations at the tip of the nose. Once you understand how to calm mental activity while increasing mental energy, the clarity of breath sensations will increase, and the continuity of attention will become steady yet effortless. When this develops, you are ready to develop Marker 09: Sustained Attention.

Insight Section:

Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.

Insight: Insight is developed at this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about creating conditions that support clarity of Marker 08: One Point of Sensation at the tip of the nose, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 08: Subtle Dullness.

Meditative Hindrance: Subtle Dullness (08).
Loss of clarity of sensation in your meditation object.

Subtle dullness refers to the experience of the disappearance of your ability to perceive sensations within your breathing (or meditation object). While Gross Dullness is defined as dullness in both your meditation object and mind, Subtle Dullness is defined as an increased dullness in your meditation object while still maintaining clarity of your peripheral awareness. While experiencing subtle dullness, your mind will be clear, lucid, and tranquil. Because of this, it is easy to be deluded into thinking that you have entered an absorption state. If not addressed, this experience will repeat, and you will not reach more refined levels of samadhi (unification/collectedness of mind), and grosser hindrances will start to arise again, causing your samadhi to weaken.

Antidote:
Developing your skill in cultivating increased clarity of breath sensations plus increased awareness of your body experience in the background creates the conditions for Marker 08, and is the antidote for the Hindrance of Subtle Dullness. To prevent subtle dullness from occurring, increase your curiosity and develop samatha (relaxation, calm) from the beginning of your meditation. At Marker 07, increase the detail of the elemental qualities within each breath. When you reach Marker 08, aim to increase the clarity of the sensations at the tip of your nose. Arousing enjoyment by smiling with your eyes toward the growing feeling of pleasantness, of growing calm and tranquillity, will aid in keeping your mind's interest and removing all dullness from your mind.

Daily Application:

Meditation 08 in Daily Life:

- Gently soften awareness into your body until it feels grounded, present, now.
- Relax and allow your awareness of your body to shift to the background.
- During quiet time, learn to tune into the flow of breathing at the tip of your nose.
- Tune into the changing sensations in one point of contact while softening your effort.
- Feel the subtle pleasantness in each letting go that occurs with each natural breath.

Tip: To avoid altering your breathing patterns or producing strain, I recommend being mindful of your breathing only during organised quiet times, and not striving to be mindful of the breath throughout the day. A more effective meditation object for achieving insight throughout your day is an open, peripheral awareness of your body, which creates a more present reference point.

Progression Criteria:

You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 09: Sustained Attention when:

- As a natural progression of letting go, you become aware of your attention resting on one point of breath sensation. Awareness of those sensations is clear to you, and there is a distinct experience of unmoving tranquillity in peripheral awareness.

Tip: Due to the immaturity of meditative joy and tranquillity, there will still be some subtle wandering and restlessness within your attention. These two hindrances will calm in Meditation Skill 09: Sustained Attention by increasing enjoyment & tranquillity.
