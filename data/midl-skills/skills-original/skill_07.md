Meditation Skill 07
Cultivation: CALM & TRANQUILLITY
Name: Breath Sensations
Subtitle: How to transform gross dullness into clear breath sensation.

Quote: "When sloth & torpor are present within them, the meditator knows: 'There is sloth & torpor present within me'. When there is no sloth & torpor present within them, the meditator knows: 'There is no sloth & torpor present within me'." The Buddha, MN 10.

Overview:
As your body, breathing, and mind calm, you can now begin to relax the habitual wandering of your attention. In MIDL we do this by shifting the focus of attention from the whole length of each breath, to resting on the experience of breathing at the tip of our nose.

Duration:
Meditation Length: 45 minutes. Due to the increased time it takes to develop calm increase your meditation time by 5 minutes.

Benefits:
This Meditation Skill will teach you how to increase your focus on the present task by developing calm within your mind rather than through effort.

Purpose:
Increase mindfulness and clear comprehension of the elemental qualities of breath sensations to increase calm and remove the conditions for gross dullness.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-06.
Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-06, except you now add Steps 2-4 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:

- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.

Additions for developing Breath Sensations in Skill 07:

Step 2: Calm your body, breathing and mind.
As your awareness settles on the whole length of each breath for a period of time without distraction in Skill 06, begin to relax any final effort you feel in your body, breathing and mind to develop calm. Relaxing and allowing the remaining effort to dissipate through these three stages while tuning into how nice it feels will bring a sense of calm to your body, breathing, and mind.
As your body, breathing, and mind calm, allow your attention to rest on the sensations of each breath at the tip of your nose while maintaining a 30% peripheral awareness of your whole-body breathing.

Step 3: Tune into the elemental quality of each breath.
Tune into the flow of sensations as air enters and leaves your nose and divide those sensations into elemental qualities as the breath comes in and goes out. Begin by experiencing them separately, clarifying one before moving onto the next.

- Coolness & warmth: First, notice the feeling of coolness in your nose with each in-breath, changing into warmth with each out-breath.
- Pressure: Once this is clear, notice the changing feeling of pressure within your nose and head with each in and out-breath.
- Wetness & dryness: Then increase mindfulness by being aware of the subtle feeling of dryness on each in-breath and moistening on each out-breath.
- Breath length: When comfortable with these previous three, start to notice how each in and out-breath changes direction.

Tip: To transition from Skill 07 to Skill 08, you will calm your mind's perception of breath length by calming your mind's perception of time.

Step 4: Enhance your enjoyment in the growing calm.
As your mind becomes interested in the elemental qualities within each breath, it will begin to withdraw energy from your intellectual mind. As your intellectual mind relaxes the experience of over calm will begin to grow. You can enhance your enjoyment of the feeling of calm by gently smiling with your eyes toward it and allowing yourself to appreciate it.

Tip: Gross Dullness is a rite of passage for the insight meditator. It occurs during mindfulness of breathing when we become skilled in samadhi (unification of mind / collectedness) but are not yet competent in balancing it with clear comprehension. Be vigilant and develop an understanding of how your mind gradually dulls as samadhi in mindfulness of breathing develops. Learn to counter this dullness by arousing curiosity, finding enjoyment in letting go and increasing the clarity of your comprehension of the elemental experience of your meditation objects.

Insight Section:

Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.

Insight: Insight is developed at this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about creating conditions that support clarity of Marker 07: Breath Sensations at the tip of the nose, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 07: Gross Dullness.

Meditative Hindrance: Gross Dullness (07).
Loss of clarity in both your mind and your meditation object.

Gross Dullness refers to the experience of an extreme lowering of your ability to be aware of any experience. This is experienced as a loss of clarity in both your mind and your meditation object. Gross Dullness is a sign of progress in meditation and reflects the deepening of a meditator's samadhi (unification of mind).

Gross Dullness occurs as the meditator develops physical and mental relaxation, and they inadvertently over-calm the ability for awareness to know an experience. Gross Dullness (sinking mind or sloth & torpor) is a rite of passage for the meditator. It refines the meditator's skill in relaxing while maintaining a clear comprehension of their present experience. As you learn to balance the effort, the Awakening Factor of Right Effort will mature, and you will no longer experience gross dullness. If not addressed, Gross Dullness will weaken your samadhi and cause your mind to slip back to Hindrances 06: Mind Wandering, 04: Habitual Forgetting, and then, if really strong, Hindrances: 03: Sleepiness & Drifting, 02: Mental Restlessness and 01: Physical Restlessness will manifest.

Antidote:
Become familiar with and apply the antidotes in the article: Working with Dullness.

Tip: It is important to note that although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Gross Dullness at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the above Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance. As you develop intimacy with the length of each breath, and the level of calm increases in your body, breathing and mind, it is easy to become too calm and lower the ability of your mind to be aware of any experience. The complete dulling of awareness is a sign of progress in meditation and a rite of passage for all insight meditators. It is essential to understand that your mind does not instantly become grossly dull; it is a gradual process of conditions that lead up to it. By becoming sensitive to the gradual dulling of your mind from Skill 01: Body Relaxation and increasing the detail of your noticing up to Skill 09: Breath Sensation, Gross Dullness will not arise within your mind.

Daily Application:

Meditation Skill 07 in Daily Life:

- Gently soften awareness into your body until it feels grounded, present, now.
- Relax and allow your awareness of your body to shift to the background.
- During quiet time, learn to tune into the flow of breathing at the tip of your nose.
- Tune into the changing sensations at the tip of your nose while softening your effort to do so.
- Feel the subtle pleasantness of letting go that occurs with each natural breath.

Tip: To avoid altering your breathing patterns or producing strain, I recommend being mindful of sensations at the tip of your nose only during organised quiet times, and not striving to be mindful of the breath throughout the day. A more effective meditation object for achieving insight throughout your day is an open, peripheral awareness of your body, which creates a more present reference point.

Progression Criteria:

You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 08: One Point of Sensation when:

- You feel confident in your ability to remove the conditions supporting Gross Dullness before it arises, and you clearly perceive the changing elemental qualities of your breathing at the tip of your nose without effort or strain and without forgetting them.
