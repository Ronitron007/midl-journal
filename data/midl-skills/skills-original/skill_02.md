Subtitle: How to transform mental restlessness into mind relaxation

Quote: "The meditator understands how the arising of un-arisen restlessness comes to be, and how to abandon restlessness once it has arisen; they also understand the conditions for the non-arising of restlessness once it has been abandoned." The Buddha, MN 10.

Overview: As you relax your body in Skill 01, a feeling of relaxation & comfort will grow, making you aware of the restlessness of your mind's interest in the past & future. In Skill 02, you will mentally relax this interest with slow breaths out through your nose while relaxing your eyelids to develop ease.

Duration: 30 minutes
Benefits: This Skill will teach you how to relax mental restlessness caused by intrusive thoughts with gentle breaths and help you to fall asleep at night.
Purpose: Create space around thoughts and mind narratives by learning to relax your mind's interest in the past and future, thereby increasing awareness of your body.

MEDITATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: Meditation Skill 01
Sit for meditation and develop relaxation of your body in Meditation Skill 01.

Your Meditation So Far:

- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body.

Step 2: Relax your mind with slow out-breaths
After relaxing your body in Skill 01, take five more breaths, but this time allow a slow breath out through your nose with each out-breath. Slowing the out-breath through the nose has a calming effect on the mind.

Step 3: Relax your eyelids to relax your mind
Repeat with five more breaths, and increase the relaxation of your mind by allowing your eyelids to droop with each out-breath. Relaxing our eyelids signals the mind to relax and fall asleep. Relaxing our eyelids slowly and deliberately with clear comprehension helps to relax our mind without becoming dull and sleepy.

Step 4: Enjoy the relaxation
Once you feel physically and mentally relaxed, allow your breathing to happen naturally for the rest of your meditation.

INSIGHT INTO MENTAL RESTLESSNESS:

Insight: Insight is developed in this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about creating the conditions that support Marker 02: Mind Relaxation to weaken the conditions that support Hindrance 02: Mental Restlessness.

Meditative Hindrance: Mental Restlessness (02)
Unable to experience mental comfort, leading to thinking about the past and the future.
Mental Restlessness refers to when you feel mentally unsettled due to high energy levels from excess effort, stress/anxiety, or overstimulation.

Antidote: Developing your skill in relaxing your mind creates the conditions for Marker 02. To settle mental restlessness, be curious about what it means to relax effort in your mind. Take slow and gentle breaths out through your nose while focusing on the area of your frontal lobe. As you exhale, try to feel this area relaxing, and complement this by softening your eyelids.

DAILY APPLICATION:

Check in: How am I feeling now? Is my mind restless and inclining toward negativity?

In Meditation Skill 02, you will learn four things for daily life:

1. To recognise mental restlessness.
2. To relax mental restlessness.
3. To appreciate how nice it feels to relax your mind & body.
4. To notice that whenever you relax your mind body, awareness of your body increases.

SUPPORT TEACHING: SATI SAMPAJAÑÑA (Mindfulness with Clear Comprehension)

Sati: Mindfulness = Keep in mind and remember the present experience.
Sampajañña: Clear Comprehension = tracking the conditional changes within present experience over time.

While it is the function of mindfulness to remember the present experience, it is the function of clear comprehension to track the process of conditioned change within the present experience over time.

PROGRESSION CRITERIA:
You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 03: Mindful Presence when you can relax thoughts about the past and future when you notice them and feel physically and mentally comfortable, with no desire to get up from your meditation.
