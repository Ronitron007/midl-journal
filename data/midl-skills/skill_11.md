### Step 2: Intimacy with pleasantness

As your experience of your sense fields fades, so will your experience of sensations within your breath-body. As your mind enters a state of seclusion from sensory stimulation, it will experience a sense of relief, and the sensations within your body will be replaced by pleasurable feelings that reflect this enjoyment of letting go. What will remain is the pleasurable, blissful feeling of piti throughout your breath-body and the joyful happiness of sukha within your mind and heart. The mind-created pleasurable experience of piti is now your meditation object.

### Step 3: Sustained awareness

Continue to increase your intimacy with the pleasurable feeling of piti, allowing awareness to experience it from within. Continue until awareness enters an autonomous flow, accompanied by a feeling of blissful pleasantness. This is experienced as the transition between effort and effortlessness.

At this stage, awareness has begun to sustain with the pleasurable blissful sensation (piti). Your awareness will begin to feel steady, stable and unmoving. Remain with this enjoyable, blissful feeling and offer it your complete, undivided attention. As you do, your strength and clarity will increase.

Allow your awareness and attention to unify in the foreground, focusing on the pleasantness of your whole-body breathing (piti), and let sensory experiences fade into the background, allowing for peripheral awareness.

## Tips

- As you become more aware of the experience of breathing throughout your whole body, you will find that your awareness begins to develop an intimacy with it. Intimacy of awareness refers to the exclusivity of attention you give to someone you care about, letting them know how much you care, free from any external distractions. As the intimacy of your awareness of whole-body breathing increases, the boundaries of your body and the sensations within it will fade. This is not a sign of dullness, as your mind at this stage is beyond it, but rather an observation of the gradual shutting down of the body's sensory doors because your mind no longer gives importance to them. This same process is happening to your other senses, but because of your exclusive awareness of your body, it will not be as obvious.
- Most importantly, your mind senses are also undergoing a calming process because they are no longer being stimulated. As this happens, they will gradually enter a state of pleasure and seclusion. This pleasure cannot be understood in terms of worldly pleasure, which seeks and wants more, but rather the joy of letting go, putting down, and releasing. As your mind enters a state of seclusion from sensory stimulation, it will experience a sense of relief, and the sensations within your body will be replaced by pleasurable feelings that reflect this enjoyment of letting go.
- It is important to note that although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Anticipation of Pleasure at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the above Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance. As you increase intimacy with the pleasantness of your body-breath experience, your awareness will begin to withdraw from the six sense fields. As your body is one of the five physical senses, as its sensitivity fades, the borders of your body and sensations within your body will also fade away. As sensation sensitivity fades, all that will be left is a refined pleasurable feeling of piti, replacing the body-breath with the joyful happiness of sukha in the background. This piti-sukha is now your meditation object to develop the final step before jhana, access concentration.

## Insight

- Marker: 11 - Sustained Awareness
- Hindrance: 11 - Anticipation of Pleasure
- Antidote: Developing your skill in cultivating intimacy with the feeling of pleasantness of your body as it breathes is the antidote for the Hindrance of Anticipation of Pleasure. Anticipation of Pleasure in your meditation will naturally calm as your mind becomes more intimate with the enjoyable aspects of your present experience. Repeated exposure to the pleasantness of your meditation and the blissful, piti feeling that arises will cause your mind to be no longer excited by it. You can further weaken the Hindrance of Anticipation of Pleasure by refining contentment in all aspects of your life. Increasing intimacy with the pleasantness of your whole body as it breathes will withdraw all energy from craving and allow awareness to sustain itself in access concentration.

## Progression

Criteria: When you become aware of an increased feeling of steadiness of awareness accompanied by fading of the sense fields and the sensations in your body fade, leaving an increasingly pleasurable, blissful feeling (piti) and joyful happiness (sukha) that fills the experience of your awareness.
