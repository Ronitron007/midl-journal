The appearance of the experience of your body breathing is the sign that your mind is ready for Skill 05. If the experience of your breathing is unclear at this stage, it is a sign that you need to spend more time learning to relax your body and mind. The quieter you become through relaxation, the more sensitive your body will become to your breathing. It is important to note that mind wandering and forgetting you are meditating for short periods is normal at this stage of meditation, will still be present at this time and will not fully settle down until the maturing of Skill 06. If you are feeling stuck and can't experience any pleasant feelings in your meditation in Skill 04, it is okay to move on to Skill 05. If your body feels present, and as you relax, you become aware of the movement of breathing in your body, it is okay to move on to Skill 05.

It is important to note that it is only necessary to weaken habitual control at this stage, not to be completely free from it. If your mind, for example, causes your breathing to tighten so that it is difficult to breathe, then habitual control needs to be weakened before moving on. However, if while being aware of the breath, your mind calms down, a sign of this is being aware of the whole length of each breath, then it is perfectly ok to move on to the next stage in your meditation."

As your mind and body relax and mindfulness develops, the time your mind wanders will shorten. It is how quickly you notice that your mind has wandered from your breath and body, and mindfulness returns that is most important here."
