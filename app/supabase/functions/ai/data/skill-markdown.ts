Cultivation: 01 - Mindfulness of Body
Subtitle: How to transform stress breathing into diaphragmatic breathing.
Duration: 20 minutes daily

## Overview

Your first step is to learn to access relaxation and calm by retraining any stress-breathing patterns that may be present from your busy day. Simple changes in the way you breathe will lower stress and anxiety and prepare your breathing patterns for mindfulness of breathing in Skill 05.

## Benefits

- This Skill will desensitise your mind's tendency to respond to stress and anxiety in daily life.
- It will also help you make diaphragmatic breathing a natural part of your practice in preparation for mindfulness of breathing.

## Purpose

Retrain your breathing patterns to settle the experience of stress and anxiety in preparation for deeper states of calm and insight during mindfulness of breathing.

## Instructions

Practising slow, diaphragmatic breathing helps interrupt the stress response by calming the factors that contribute to stress and anxiety. With regular practice, breathing with your diaphragm will become your body's natural way of breathing throughout the day, resulting in reduced reactivity in stressful situations. Training your body to breathe calmly provides a foundation for mindfulness of breathing in Skill 05, allowing you to relax more easily.

I recommend practising this meditation to retrain your stress-breathing patterns and lower the experience of stress and anxiety for 3-4 weeks or until you naturally breathe in your belly rather than in your chest. This breathing technique changed my life and the lives of many others who were ready to develop a deeper understanding of their body and mind.

### Step 1: Learn how to breathe with your diaphragm

Start by lying on the floor. If needed, use a pillow under your head and a rolled blanket under your knees. Place both palms below your belly button, pressing slightly inwards so that you can feel the movement of your belly as you breathe.

Slowly raising and lowering your abdomen will cause your diaphragm muscle to engage and get stronger. Lie down as described above and try these steps:
- Gently raise your palms away from your body by slowly extending the lower part of your abdomen upwards. Then, lower your palms by slowly lowering your abdomen.
- Next, notice that air is drawn in through your nose when your abdomen rises and expelled out again as your lower abdomen falls.
- Take five slow, relaxing breaths by slowly raising and lowering your abdomen. Do this a few times until you are comfortable with the movement.

### Step 2: Gently slow down your breathing rate

Slowing down the movement of your abdominal breaths will slow down your breathing rate, increasing carbon dioxide reabsorption and increasing the calming effect.
- Take ten more relaxing breaths by slowing down the movement of raising and lowering your abdomen. Keep this movement relaxed so that it feels comfortable.
- Important: You are simply reminding your body how to breathe in this step. After 10 slow belly breaths allow your body to breathe naturally by itself without your help for a while before moving onto the next step.

### Step 3: Breathe from your abdomen into your chest

Once you have done ten repetitions of breathing with your abdomen, the next stage is to learn to breathe from your abdomen up into your chest.
- Bring one palm to the top of your chest, leave the other below your belly button.
- Slowly breathe in from your belly button, extending your ribs out slightly and allow the breath to fill your chest like a balloon.
- At the end of each in-breath, allow your whole body to relax with a slow out-breath.
- Repeat ten times with slow, gentle breaths, free from strain.

### Step 4: Lie still and allow your breathing to happen naturally

This final stage of lying still and doing nothing is essential in lowering anxiety as it reinforces diaphragmatic breathing; it will teach your body and mind how to relax deeply.
- Stop controlling your breathing, allowing it to find its own rhythm and pace.
- If your mind wants to control your breathing, distract yourself by being aware of different parts of your body touching the floor.
- Lie still and allow your breathing to happen by itself while being aware of its calming effect.

## Tips

- For insight, be curious about how breathing in your chest is related to stress and how it makes you feel. Also, explore slow, diaphragmatic breaths and how they can transform the feeling of stress and anxiety into one of relaxation and calm.
- At this stage of meditation, thinking about the past and future, mind wandering and falling asleep are not a problem; your goal is to gently train your body to breathe with your diaphragm muscle to calm stress and anxiety that may be present when you begin your meditation.
- If your mind tends toward overthinking whatever you are doing or obsessive control you may find that diaphragmatic breathing does not help you to relax. In this case I recommend first creating a place of safety for your mind by practicing daily Stillness meditation. To weaken OCD: https://midlmeditation.com/meditation-for-ocd
- When retraining stress breathing patterns, it is important to acknowledge that you are working with a habit. Because habit plays a role in stress and anxiety, you may find at first that diaphragmatic breathing (in your belly) only occurs for a short time after your meditation, before it switches back to stress breathing (upper chest) again. The habitual changing of your breathing back to stress breathing is normal and part of the process of changing a habit. To break a habit of stress breathing requires clear yet kind repetition of how you would like your breathing to behave throughout the day. When working with a habit, it's essential to maintain positivity and celebrate small successes, such as feeling a few moments of relaxation during meditation, rather than dwelling on what's wrong. Negativity will only lead to further deepening your stress and anxiety and not to the end of them.

## Obstacles

### Experiencing struggle and strain

Be careful of any over-effort or strain. Anxiety can generate the desire to try to fix and to control things within our lives. If you notice any struggle or strain, then stop what you are doing for a short while and allow yourself to relax before starting again. Breathing in the lower belly is enjoyable if it is done in a relaxed and gentle way. Avoid the urge to overinflate your belly or to try harder; slow, gentle movement is the key. Feel your way into this simple exercise. When the rhythm is correct, it will feel good, and the feeling of relaxation and calm in your body and mind will increase.

### Feeling light-headed

Because you are not used to breathing this slowly, you may experience some light-headedness. Whenever you experience this, stop the exercise for a while and allow yourself to stay still until the symptoms settle down. Generally, after 10 seconds, this feeling will settle, leaving you feeling calmer and more relaxed. Once it has settled, you can resume your training. With regular practice, this light-headed feeling will gradually lessen and no longer occur. See your doctor if light-headedness persists.

### Feeling like you don't have enough air

If stress breathing is normal for you, then you may feel as if you are not getting enough air when you slow your breathing rate. If this feeling arises, it's okay to take a few extra breaths to settle it down. Once your belly breathing movement slows down, the sense of needing more air will gradually dissipate.

### Your breathing feels tight

If you feel a tightness in your lower chest when you breathe in, you may be breathing in from the top of your chest downwards in an attempt to push your breath down into your belly. This will not work. The diaphragm muscle is dome-shaped and cannot be pushed down; it needs to be pulled. It can be helpful to think of your diaphragm as an upside-down plunger. When you pull the handle downward, the plunger will suck in air, and as you push it back up, it expels it. To engage your diaphragm muscle, slowly raise the lower part of your abdomen upwards rather than trying to push air down into it from your chest. Placing your palms below your belly button, as in the instructions above, will allow you to feel the movement as you breathe.

## Insight

- Marker: 00 - Diaphragm Breathing
- Hindrance: 00 - Stress Breathing
- Antidote: Be curious about what it means to find enjoyment in taking slow, gentle diaphragmatic breaths. Be curious about finding the sweet spot for you, where breathing feels free from strain and like a nice thing to do. This sweet spot, where you know how much to fill your belly and how slowly to move, is different for everyone. This is why you need to be curious about finding your sweet spot, because this is different for everyone due to various body shapes and sensitivities. A sign that you have found the right rhythm for you is that it will feel nice to do, and you will begin to relax in your body and mind. Also, after doing a series of diaphragmatic breaths in your belly, your body will continue to breathe with your diaphragm by itself, for the rest of your meditation.

Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.

We begin mindfulness of breathing by creating the conditions that support Marker 00: Diaphragmatic Breathing, to lower the experience of stress, by developing insight into and weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 00: Stress Breathing.

Stress breathing refers to taking short, shallow breaths in the chest when the stress response is activated, preparing the body to respond to danger by fighting or fleeing. When we are exposed to stressful situations repeatedly or have experienced trauma in our lives, our stress response can become habitual. Stress breathing can then become our natural way of breathing throughout the day, putting our mind and body in a hypervigilant and hypersensitive state. This makes the development of relaxation and calm (samatha) difficult in meditation. It is because of this that many meditators have trouble being mindful of their breathing. By changing our breathing patterns from stress breathing to rest and digest (diaphragmatic) breathing, our mind more easily enters a relaxed state, and the pleasure of letting go in meditation becomes more accessible.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "Where am I breathing now? Is it in my chest or my belly?"

If your breathing has shifted up into your chest, then the stress response has been activated. This is okay; stress breathing and sensitivity to stress reactions are habits that can develop over time. Being a habit, there is an advantage that with deliberate exercises, you can change it.

How to reengage diaphragmatic breathing: https://soundcloud.com/user-677685629/re-engaging-the-diaphragm-for-anxiety

### Steps

1. First, ground yourself in a present experience in your body by squeezing one hand in the other or feeling your feet on the ground. The nowness of your body will help to withdraw your mind from fearful thoughts.
2. Next, place your palms just below your belly button, pressing in slightly so that you will be able to feel the movement in your belly as you breathe.
3. Slowly extend your lower abdomen outwards, as you did in your seated meditation, to draw breath in through your nose. Slowly lower your abdomen back to allow the breath to go out through your nose, using this belly breathing movement like a pump.
4. Take five slow in-and-out breaths in this way, allowing your shoulders to drop and your body to relax, each time the breath goes out.
5. After five slow breaths, wait ten seconds and observe any changes within your mind, body and breathing for insight. This will help you to refine your technique and gain an understanding of the relationship between how you breathe throughout the day and feelings of stress and anxiety.

Apply this method a few times per day. Not obsessively, simply by just checking in at key times to see how you are feeling today.

### Learnings

- Stress and anxiety can become habituated, and due to this, they can perpetuate themselves. The key here is to learn how to relax through your breathing, creating small gaps in this stress habit.
- By noticing when you feel stressed and reengaging your diaphragm with slow diaphragmatic breaths, you will begin to decondition any stress habit that may be present.

## Progression

Criteria: You experience a feeling of relaxation and ease after taking slow breaths in your belly, and diaphragmatic breathing in your belly happens naturally during your meditation and for a while after you have finished meditating.

## Overview

Your next step is to increase your body awareness by enjoying how nice it feels to relax your body with slow, gentle breathing. This step helps to alleviate feelings of physical restlessness related to stress and enhances body awareness in preparation for mindfulness of breathing in Skill 05.

## Benefits

- This Meditation Skill will teach you how to lower your experience of physical restlessness and access the first stage of meditation, feeling comfortable in your body.

## Purpose

To teach your mind to find enjoyment in relaxing your body and to settle stress-based restlessness as preparation for mindfulness of your body.

- PDF: MIDL Meditation Skill 01 Detailed Instructions

## Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation for meditation

In this meditation, you move from lying down in Skill 00 to sitting upright with your legs crossed on a cushion on the floor, on a kneeling stool, or resting on a comfortable, supportive chair.

Sit in meditation with one palm resting in the other, and feel the awareness of your whole body as you sit in meditation. You will be using awareness of your body as the meditation object.

### Step 2: Develop mindfulness

Mindfulness is the meditative skill of gently remembering (keeping in mind) what you are experiencing now in your body, mind and senses.

Listen to the flow of sound: Actively listen to sounds around you, the way they flow and change. Allow the presence of sound to develop mindfulness by gently keeping it in mind.

Feel your clothing on your body: As you relax, you will naturally become aware of your clothing touching your body and the coolness/warmth of air touching your skin.

### Step 3: Relax your body with slow breaths

In MIDL, these slow, relaxing breaths are known as softening breaths because your body and mind become softer as you relax.

Relax with diaphragmatic (belly) breaths: Take five softening breaths by slowly moving your belly outward and then slowly lowering it back.

Relax with full-body breaths: Take five more slow inhales, starting in your belly, bringing the breath up to fill your chest, and then, with each exhale, allow your whole body to relax.

### Step 4: Enjoy the relaxation

After taking these softening breaths, allow your breathing to return to its natural rhythm; enjoy the growing relaxation and comfort in your body for the rest of the meditation.

## Tips

- Tune into how nice it feels to be present with these simple experiences: this is the key to deepening meditation.

## Obstacles

### Physical Restlessness

Unable to experience physical comfort. Physical Restlessness refers to feeling of being unsettled in your body, which prompts you to move around and fidget. It occurs during meditation due to the build-up of energy from stress, aversion, or overstimulation in our daily lives.

## Insight

- Marker: 01 - Body Relaxation
- Hindrance: 01 - Physical Restlessness
- Antidote: Developing your skill in relaxing your body creates the conditions for Marker 01. To settle physical restlessness, cultivate curiosity in finding enjoyment as you relax your body with slow, diaphragmatic, belly breaths. As you exhale, allow a part of your body, such as your shoulders, to relax slowly and deliberately so that you can feel the bodily relaxation.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "Are you holding too much effort in your body?"

### Learnings

- To recognise physical restlessness.
- To relax physical restlessness.
- To appreciate how nice it feels to relax your body.
- To notice that whenever you relax your body, awareness of your body increases.

### Steps

1. Enjoy noticing when you've forgotten to be mindful.
2. Take a few breaths to relax your body when you notice.
3. Finding enjoyment in the relaxing breaths.
4. Clearly comprehending awareness returning to your body as you do.
5. Being satisfied with creating small gaps in mind wandering.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress when you experience periods of feeling relaxed and comfortable during your meditation, and you understand how to settle physical restlessness with slow, softening belly breaths.

> "The meditator understands how the arising of un-arisen restlessness comes to be, and how to abandon restlessness once it has arisen; they also understand the conditions for the non-arising of restlessness once it has been abandoned." — The Buddha, MN 10

## Overview

As you relax your body in Skill 01, a feeling of relaxation & comfort will grow, making you aware of the restlessness of your mind's interest in the past & future. In Skill 02, you will mentally relax this interest with slow breaths out through your nose while relaxing your eyelids to develop ease.

## Benefits

- Teaches how to relax mental restlessness caused by intrusive thoughts with gentle breaths
- Helps you to fall asleep at night

## Purpose

Create space around thoughts and mind narratives by learning to relax your mind's interest in the past and future, thereby increasing awareness of your body.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Meditation Skill 01

Sit for meditation and develop relaxation of your body in Meditation Skill 01.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body.

### Step 2: Relax your mind with slow out-breaths

After relaxing your body in Skill 01, take five more breaths, but this time allow a slow breath out through your nose with each out-breath. Slowing the out-breath through the nose has a calming effect on the mind.

### Step 3: Relax your eyelids to relax your mind

Repeat with five more breaths, and increase the relaxation of your mind by allowing your eyelids to droop with each out-breath. Relaxing our eyelids signals the mind to relax and fall asleep. Relaxing our eyelids slowly and deliberately with clear comprehension helps to relax our mind without becoming dull and sleepy.

### Step 4: Enjoy the relaxation

Once you feel physically and mentally relaxed, allow your breathing to happen naturally for the rest of your meditation.

## Obstacles

### Sati Sampajañña (Mindfulness with Clear Comprehension)

Sati: Mindfulness = Keep in mind and remember the present experience.
Sampajañña: Clear Comprehension = tracking the conditional changes within present experience over time.

While it is the function of mindfulness to remember the present experience, it is the function of clear comprehension to track the process of conditioned change within the present experience over time.

## Insight

- Marker: 02 - Mind Relaxation
- Hindrance: 02 - Mental Restlessness
- Antidote: Developing your skill in relaxing your mind creates the conditions for Marker 02. To settle mental restlessness, be curious about what it means to relax effort in your mind. Take slow and gentle breaths out through your nose while focusing on the area of your frontal lobe. As you exhale, try to feel this area relaxing, and complement this by softening your eyelids.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How am I feeling now? Is my mind restless and inclining toward negativity?"

### Learnings

- To recognise mental restlessness
- To relax mental restlessness
- To appreciate how nice it feels to relax your mind & body
- To notice that whenever you relax your mind body, awareness of your body increases

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 03: Mindful Presence when you can relax thoughts about the past and future when you notice them and feel physically and mentally comfortable, with no desire to get up from your meditation.

## Overview

As you enjoy relaxing during Skills 01 and 02, you will naturally develop an increased awareness of your body. As enjoyment grows, so will your mind's contentment with it, and a sense of being mindfully present within your body will also increase, removing sleepiness and dullness.

## Benefits

- Teaches you how to stay present in your body throughout the day
- Increases awareness of your mental habits
- Allows you to change habits gradually by developing mindful nonparticipation with slow, softening breaths

## Purpose

Develop a natural mindfulness and clear comprehension of your body in preparation for mindfulness of breathing and insight during your daily activities.

## Instructions

You now introduce your ability to relax and soften, learned in Meditation Skills 01 and 02, to find enjoyment and contentment with the growing presence within your body. The key is to take your time being mindfully aware and to develop contentment with each of these stages.

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-02

Sit for meditation and develop Meditation Skills 01 and 02 as you have in previous meditations, except you now add the below Steps 2-4 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.

Additions for developing Mindful Presence in Skill 03:

### Step 2: Mindful Presence in your Body

As the enjoyment of relaxation in your body and mind increases in Skill 02, a feeling of being mindful and present in your body will develop by itself. Mindful Presence naturally occurs whenever we relax both body and mind while clearly being aware of what it feels like to relax in our body and mind and enjoy that feeling.

### Step 3: Develop Contentment with this Presence

As mindfulness and presence in your body grow, notice and begin to gently soften any tendency of your mind to look forward to a future result or to dwell on what just happened. Looking forward and back can develop discontent and hinder your mind from finding enjoyment in meditation, or by dwelling on what has just happened. It is helpful at this stage of meditation to be curious about finding enjoyment and contentment with the simplicity of resting in your body at this time. Nothing to do, nowhere to go, no one to be; how nice is this? Is there a need to add something else to this experience?

### Step 4: Introduce the GOSS Formula

How to develop insight and let go.
- Ground.
- Observe.
- Soften.
- Smile.
- Repeat if needed.

Ground = Develop mindful presence by intentionally softening and relaxing your body and mind.
Observe = Notice whenever you lose awareness of your body and become distracted.
Soften = Relax your body and mind with gentle breaths to let go of distractions and return your awareness to your body.
Smile = Enjoy the feeling of pleasantness that you can feel as you let go, and mindful presence returns to your body to reward your mind for letting go.

## Tips

- Once you have developed mindfulness of your body in Skill 03, you can use the presence of your body as a reference point for developing insight into the anatta (autonomous) nature of your mind's habits and teach your mind to let them go. Allocate the end of each meditation session to practice this formula on any distractions that arise, such as mind wandering and thinking, to refine your skill. The trick is to use the feeling of mindful presence in your body as a grounding (reference) point, resting your attention on the touch of your thumbs, and play a game by allowing your mind to wander. When you do, your attention will shift to a thought or memory, and gradually, you will get lost in it. When you notice this has happened, you can apply the GOSS Formula below to begin your insight game again. Enjoying the pleasant experience of contentment with the presence of your body will gradually weaken habitual mind wandering and forgetting.
- It is important to note that although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Sleepiness & Dullness at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed below it may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the Progression Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance.

## Obstacles

### Sleepiness & Dullness

Loss of clarity of body sensations and a sleepy, dull feeling in your mind.

Sleepiness and Dullness refer to a state of relaxation during meditation where you feel sleepy, and your mind drifts and floats, causing you to lose clarity of the elemental qualities of your body as you sit in meditation. This happens because your skill in relaxing your body and mind is improving; however, your skill in mindfully and clearly comprehending your present experience is still weak and needs to be strengthened to bring balance back to your mind.

### Doubt: A Regular Visitor Until Stream Entry

Stream Entry (Sotapanna) is the first of four main insights in Buddhist Insight Meditation that permanently removes the conditions that support doubt. Until Stream Entry, it is normal for insight meditators to be visited by doubts about our practice at different times. If we get stuck in doubt, it will paralyse our practice; if we use it skilfully as a motivation for curiosity, doubt will deepen our insight.

Doubt is not on the list of hindrances in MIDL because doubt can occur anytime during your meditation until you complete the first insight path at Stream Entry. Until Stream Entry-Insight, it is normal for doubts about your ability to meditate, the meditation method, or your meditation teacher to arise within your mind. It is important to understand that until the First Path Insight, Stream Entry (which uproots doubt), the purpose of your meditation practice is to reveal, understand, and significantly weaken doubt within your mind. This means being intentionally aware of the negative background commentary within your mind, as it constantly judges and offers words of wisdom. Learning to see any doubt in your mind simply as a defensive mechanism trying to protect you from the danger of not getting it right.

It also means seeing that the background doubtful commentator uses unpleasant feelings (vedana) and convincing arguments to encourage you to fall back into old habits and ways of doing things. Insight into doubt is developed by seeing the feedback loop of doubt within your mind and realising that it never leads anywhere good. See if you can notice how doubt creates its problems and then try to solve them. When you gently soften your interest in doubt, you may notice that when doubt is not present in your mind, there never was a problem in the first place, and everything is just as it is meant to be.

When you start to see doubt in this way, that it just leads to complication and never leads anywhere good, you will become disenchanted with the mental habit of doubt. As disenchantment grows, and your mind turns away from it, doubt not being practised or fed, will begin to weaken and fade, and saddha, as verified faith, trust and confidence, based on your own experience, will grow and create the conditions for Stream Entry, and the uprooting of doubt.

## Insight

- Marker: 03 - Mindful Presence
- Hindrance: 03 - Sleepiness & Dullness
- Antidote: Developing your skill in developing presence in your body creates the conditions for Marker 03 and is the antidote for the Hindrance of Sleepiness and Dullness. Sleepiness and Dullness occur at this stage of meditation, as you become more skilled at physically and mentally relaxing and you over-relax your mind and slip into a sleepy, drifty state. Strangely, this is a sign of progression in meditation, which means you are becoming skilled in relaxation. Developing intimacy with the first two Meditation Markers: Body & Mind Relaxation, will increase your mindfulness and prevent your mind from falling into a sleepy and dull state. Bringing more detail into your meditation, such as being aware of the elemental qualities of your body, like warmth, heaviness, and touch, plus how nice it feels to relax, will increase your mindfulness and clarity of comprehension.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "Have I lost awareness of my body?"

### Learnings

- The first three Meditation Skills have now created a foundation for the GOSS Formula in daily life
- GOSS will transform how you meditate in daily life, and as your skill develops, it will refine into a natural way of being
- Meditation Skills 01-04 are designed to develop the MIDL GOSS Formula
- Even though the Smile part of the GOSS Formula is learnt in Skill 04, you can begin to integrate GOSS into your life in Skill 03 because you are now familiar with developing mindfulness of your body by relaxing your body and mind
- The GOSS formula is a circular process of insight and pleasure reward that gradually deconditions defensive, unwholesome, and unskilful patterns of mind and heart

### Steps

1. Ground: In daily life, check in on yourself a few times per day and notice if you have lost awareness of your body. By simply relaxing your body & mind while enjoying it, as in Meditation Skills 01-02, your awareness will withdraw from your mind and become grounded within your body.
2. Observe: Once awareness is grounded in your body, you can go about your day. Check in every so often and relax your body and mind whenever mindfulness of your body fades. At some point during the day, you will likely notice that you have become lost within your mind and forgotten to be mindful of your body. This forgetting is perfectly normal and an opportunity for insight into anatta, the autonomous nature of your mind.
3. Soften: Once you notice you have lost mindfulness of your body, you take some softening breaths to soften, relax, and let go within your body and mind, allowing awareness to ground naturally within your body again.
4. Smile: The mind responds better to reward than criticism. Suppose you smile with your eyes, acknowledging the pleasant feeling that arises from softening, relaxing, and letting go. In that case, the reward that your mind receives for letting go will gradually develop mindfulness of your body as the natural dwelling place of your awareness.

### How GOSS Relates to Skills

- In Meditation Skill 01 & 02: You will learn how to let go physically and mentally. This relates to the Soften part of the GOSS Formula.
- In Meditation Skill 03: You will learn how to cultivate mindfulness of your body, allowing your awareness to become grounded within it. This relates to the Ground part of the GOSS Formula.
- In Meditation Skill 04: You will learn how to reward your mind by finding enjoyment in being mindful of your body and in letting go of distractions. This relates to the Smile part of the GOSS Formula.
- You will then have all the tools you need to train your attention and weaken hindrances such as thinking and habitual wandering.

### How to Begin GOSS in Daily Life

The GOSS Formula is a circle, with each part of the formula feeding into the next. Whichever part of the formula you begin in, whether it is observing, softening or smiling, your aim is always to return to the samatha (calm) state of mindfulness of your body to ground awareness.

Understanding this, we can see that GOSS initially begins with:
- Soften
- Smile

When you soften and relax effort in your body and mind, smiling as you enjoy that relaxation, your awareness will withdraw from your intellectual mind and Ground within your body.

At this stage of meditation, bring an investigation into your daily life as to the circular nature of GOSS. When you begin Meditation Skill 04 to develop contentment and happiness, you will learn how to fully enjoy and smile into the subtle pleasantness of relaxing and letting go in all aspects of your life.

### Support Teachings: How to Observe Attention Habitually Wander

To notice the gaps between attention and habitual inattention, you need to create a reference point. Without a reference point, it is easy to become lost in the mind's habitual patterns. A reference point is an experience that is always available, here and now, as part of your present experience. Once you have a reference point, you need to become very familiar with it so that when your mind habitually wanders from that reference point, you will notice. This is the point of seated meditation: to develop familiarity with a reference point such as your body, touch, breath, image or whatever the meditation object is—becoming so familiar with it that it is obvious when your mind forgets it.

In MIDL, the reference point is the awareness of our whole body's mindful presence, whether we are sitting in meditation or daily life. Our body is the perfect reference point because it knows nothing of the past or future. Have you considered that your body is always present, making it an excellent reference point for insight? Even better, your body can sense pleasant feelings every time you relax and let go of your interest in being stimulated by the world or your mind. This subtle pleasantness within the body, which comes from relaxing effort, makes awareness of your body attractive to your mind. As we train our minds to perceive the subtle pleasantness of relaxing and letting go, the subtle pleasantness of our bodies increases in clarity. It generates joy, making it enchanting to the mind.

Once you have your reference point, you can now observe your mind. For this next step, so that you can observe the anatta (autonomous) nature of your attention, you have to let go of control of it. This means learning to rest in the peripheral awareness of your body presence, and allow your attention to rest on the touch of your thumbs in the foreground without controlling it. This has the feeling of relaxing back on a bicycle seat and letting go of the handlebars, allowing the bicycle to steer itself.

Once you rest in the presence of your body, you can have fun by allowing your mind to wander freely. At first, it may not play the game. If it doesn't, then relax your interest in the meditation more, and it will come out to play like a playful dog. Your attention is like a dog. When it is distracted, it will hop up from your lap, bark through the fence, chew on its favourite toy, and fall asleep under a chair. Wherever your attention (dog) wanders, observe its anatta nature and call it back by softening using the GOSS Formula. Feeling your body fill with presence as you soften and relax. Smile with your eyes to bring up the pleasant feeling of letting go, enjoying it, to reward your mind for returning to presence.

To add curiosity, take an interest in the gaps between meditative attention, inattention, and the return of mindfulness. Once you have noticed this wandering, particularly that it happened by itself (anatta), gently relax your awareness back into your chosen reference point to start again. It is by observing these gaps that you will begin to see the gaps between thoughts. As samadhi (unification of mind/collectedness) develops, your mind will try to pull away from your reference point habitually but will only partially do so. Because of this, you will notice the stillness, a thought arising, its pull on your attention, and then see it cease without losing awareness of your reference point.

## Progression

Criteria: You feel contented sitting in meditation, mindful of your body, and have developed the skill of balancing energy while relaxing both your body and mind, thereby removing sleepiness and dullness. An increased sense of aware presence in your body will accompany this, reflected in a heightened sense of contentment. Congratulations, you have finished Cultivation 01.

## Overview

As a growing contentment with the presence of your body develops, you will naturally begin to enjoy it. You will then gently smile toward it with your eyes to align your mind with the enjoyment of your meditation, and to allow contentment with your meditation to grow, weakening habitual forgetting.

## Benefits

- Teaches you how to find enjoyment in contentment and enjoy simple things in life

## Purpose

Train your mind to recognise the pleasant spiritual feeling available in letting go and to create the conditions for initial meditative joy by developing contentment to shorten the time your mind is lost in habitually forgetting your meditation.

- PDF: Meditation Skill 04 Detailed Instructions

## Instructions

Your meditation is the same as Meditation Skill 03, except that you now focus on cultivating a feeling of contentment with your meditation by enjoying the nice feeling of being mindful and present in your body as developed in Skill 03. Finding enjoyment with the contentment of the simple experience of your body resting in meditation will weaken the hindrances of forgetting and mind wandering.

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-03

Develop Mindful Presence in your body as you did in Skills 01-03. Once you feel very present in your body, begin to find contentment and enjoyment in the simple act of resting mindfully in meditation by adding Steps 2-4.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being present in your body.

Additions for developing contentment and happiness in Skill 04:

### Step 2: Enjoy Contentment

Enjoy how nice it feels to be mindfully present in your body. Use a few softening breaths to gently relax any interest in past or future that comes up in your mind.

### Step 3: Smile with Your Eyes

Smile with your eyes, radiating kindness and care to connect your heart to your meditation. Just like you would smile at a loved one or a friend to let them know how much you care. Then smile toward the experience of contentment and presence in your body, allowing it to grow into an overall feeling of contentment and enjoyment.

### Step 4: Apply the GOSS Formula

To develop insight, become interested in distraction and apply the GOSS Formula anytime you observe that you have forgotten your meditation. During this stage of meditation, the main hindrance you want to weaken is the length of time you forget that you are meditating when your mind wanders to thoughts, etc. Applying the GOSS Formula and enjoying returning to the presence of your body, finding contentment in it will reward your mind for returning to mindful presence, weakening habitual mind wandering and forgetting.

GOSS Formula: How to Let Go.
- Ground.
- Observe.
- Soften.
- Smile.
- Repeat if needed.

Ground = Be mindful of the touch of your thumbs.
Observe = Enjoy noticing when you have been lost in thoughts or memories and forgot that you were meditating to create a positive reward for returning to mindfulness.
Soften = Return awareness to your body by softening/relaxing your body and mind.
Smile = Smile with your eyes, enjoying how nice it feels to let go of distraction and complexity to reward your mind letting go.

## Tips

- As your body and mind continue to relax and mental noise settles down, there will be times when you will feel breathing within your body. The appearance of the experience of breathing is a sign that relaxation is transitioning into calmness, and your sensitivity to these subtle bodily movements is increasing. It is essential not to bring your attention to your breathing and focus on it, as this may cause your mind to try to control it, leading to changes in your breathing patterns. Instead, continue to relax back into your body and enjoy your meditation. When your mind is ready to progress to Meditation Skill 05, you will find that your body begins to sense breathing by itself.
- Smiling with the eyes can be seen in the way people naturally smile toward a newborn baby, their child, intimate partner or friend. It is a heartfelt smile that comes from the heart, not from the mouth. We can observe ourselves or others smile in this way; their eyelids relax, and a feeling of care and happiness comes from the inside, sent out through their eyes. As they do this, they look the other person in the eyes, conveying to them that they care and want to connect.

## Obstacles

### Feeling Stuck on Finding Enjoyment

Are you feeling stuck on this meditation? I will start by saying that what you are experiencing in your meditation, though difficult, is exactly what is meant to be happening. The ebb and flow of enjoyment in meditation is a normal part of developing an insight meditation practice.

In MIDL, there are four rites of passage that meditators often feel stuck on:
1. Skill 04 with enjoyment and pleasure.
2. Skill 07 with gross dullness.
3. Skill 09 with becoming too tranquil.
4. Skill 12 with anticipation and fear and Stream Entry with attachment to ownership, control and doubt.

I use the word rite-of-passage because once we understand the lesson found within them deeply enough, they no longer come up again. We feel stuck in each of these areas because they are the places where we can achieve the highest results in reducing dukkha (suffering) when we develop deep enough insight into them in our daily lives.

In life, when we are interested in something, we find enjoyment in it, and when we find enjoyment in it, we become curious about it. People can find enjoyment, curiosity and the pleasure of enjoying something in anything. My mother found enjoyment and pleasure in collecting spoons. I didn't, but she did. I found enjoyment in collecting stamps when I was young and hot-rodding cars when I was a teenager. My mother didn't, but I did. This is because interest, enjoyment and how nice it feels don't come from things in life but from our attitude toward them.

If we are trying to find enjoyment in something, there will be no enjoyment, and it won't feel nice. Why? Because in our trying, we are discontent with what is happening now, trying to get somewhere else other than where we are now. In that discontentment, we lose touch with reality, lose touch with what is happening now; we become adverse toward it. When we are filled with desire and aversion, and with desire and aversion toward what is happening now, how can enjoyment and the pleasure of enjoyment come up?

Interest, enjoyment, and a sense of well-being are not unique to meditation; they are a natural part of life. Since Meditation Skill 04 onwards, there has been a focus on finding enjoyment in our meditation by being interested in how nice it feels to relax and let go; it can reveal a tendency in our mind to not find enjoyment in other aspects of our life. I am not saying that this is true for you, but it revealed to me that my mind viewed most things in my life as serious and flawed and that I wasn't truly enjoying anything. Instead, I always focused on what was wrong rather than what was right.

Curiosity is the key here. Being actively curious about what it means to find enjoyment in relaxing and letting go, and anything that hinders our ability to relax and let go and find enjoyment in it will create the conditions for interest in your meditation to arise. Interest will create the conditions for enjoyment to arise. Enjoyment will create the conditions for pleasant feelings to emerge. The pleasant feelings will create the conditions for contentment and happiness to arise. This will make the conditions for a more curious and pleasurable feedback loop to be established.

We are learning that this feedback loop of curiosity, interest, and enjoyment also happens in daily life with ordinary, everyday things. The difference between everyday life and the meditation path is that enjoyment in daily life comes from acquiring something. In contrast, enjoyment on the meditation path comes from letting things be, from letting them go. I recommend this because it is natural for human beings to smile with or through their eyes when they are content, happy and enjoying what is happening now. People use this type of smile to connect, whether it be with friends, family, or intimate partners. When we smile with our eyes in a natural, unforced way, it connects our hearts and allows our minds to access the pleasant feeling of this natural, connected happiness.

If we, however, have difficulty connecting with other people or animals in this way, if we are more defensive and closed in the way we relate to life, then this smiling will not come naturally and may not evoke any pleasant feelings at all. And this is perfectly ok. When practising generating feelings of loving-kindness, we may find that it feels mechanical, and hardly any loving feeling comes up. It is essential to acknowledge and accept that this is where we are at this time if we want to move forward. We have come to meditation wanting to feel safer and more connected, and our meditation practice has revealed this weakness. Finding interest and enjoyment in life is available to all of us by paying attention with curiosity to the simple things in life and cultivating contentment in them.

This may not initially come easily to our minds; therefore, it is our starting point. How much will my life transform if I train my mind to find enjoyment in these simple things and to connect with life around me? Be patient and playful around this. This is an opportunity for real benefits from your meditation. Can you find enjoyment in your life? If so, then recall that this is how to bring the feeling up in meditation. Is enjoyment rare in life? This explains the weakness in accessing enjoyment in meditation. This is your doorway in. Be curious to find enjoyment in the simple act of relaxing your shoulders and start to build from there.

### Observing Anatta During Meditation

To observe anatta, notice how something happens by itself. Suppose I have a reference point (grounding point) for my present experience, such as mindfulness of my body. In that case, when my mind wanders, or I find myself thinking about something, I can clearly notice that the mind wandering or thinking happened by itself.

A short reflection when your mindfulness returns and you notice that you are distracted is helpful. This reflection can be as simple as noticing that there was a period in which you had no idea what was going on: "Well, that is interesting". You can use a simple word called a label to clarify this: "distracted" or quickly reflect on what it felt like to be distracted and what it feels like to be present in your body again (soften, smile).

While typing this takes a while, noticing anatta is very quick to do. Think of making a cake, and at some stage, you quickly reflect to recall what you have done so far. When you reflect, you can quickly see the steps and then continue to focus on what you are doing now in the baking process. In the same way, it doesn't take a lot of 'thinking about things' during meditation to clearly see that your attention wandered from your meditation object to a distraction by itself.

It just takes clear seeing and developed intimacy with the experience of your meditation object, in this case, how nice it feels to be mindfully present in your body. This familiarity with mindfulness of your body will allow you to notice when you become distracted from it more easily.

Looking again and again, clearly seeing what is present and how it is behaving, will gradually make your mind more sensitive to the 'by itself nature' of experiences that occur during meditation and in daily life. It does take a clear intention and curiosity to notice that things happen 'by themselves'. Once you start to see this, it is endlessly fascinating.

Should you tell yourself something like, 'Hey, that distraction was autonomous', add a label or something else? You can do that. Some meditators say anatta, or hey, that was interesting. Being curious about the points of change between attention, inattention, and the return of attention is enough. If I watch a cat walk across a room by itself several times, any feeling that I am the cat fades away. The cat does cat things by itself; therefore, I am not the cat and allow the cat to be a cat.

If I observe the experiences of my mind and body, I will clearly see that they are doing things on their own. If I am aware of these experiences repeatedly, like the cat, and notice that they are occurring independently, without my help, the feeling that I am my body, I am my mind, will naturally also start to fade (viraga). It becomes clear when looking with curiosity and noticing things happening on their own; that is the key.

## Insight

- Marker: 04 - Content Presence
- Hindrance: 04 - Habitual Forgetting
- Antidote: Cultivating enjoyment and contentment with your present experience during meditation is the antidote to Habitual Forgetting (Hindrance 04). Your goal is to take pleasure in being fully aware of your body, allowing you to notice whenever your mind begins to wander. By finding joy in recognizing when you have lost touch with your body and become absorbed in thought, you can shorten the duration of this forgetfulness and train your mind to return to mindfulness more quickly. Criticism, judgment, and negativity regarding your tendency to forget or let your mind wander will only reinforce this habit, making being present feel unpleasant. Instead, positive reinforcement through wholesome rewards is key. The time spent in distraction can be skillfully reduced by finding joy in the process of returning to mindfulness. By tuning into the pleasant feeling of coming back to the present and letting go of distractions, you encourage your mind to return more swiftly, gradually shortening the time spent lost in distraction. Smiling gently and embracing the pleasure of softening and letting go can connect your mind to this experience, enhancing the positive rewards for your mind. This, in turn, will help weaken the hindrance of habitual forgetting and foster a healthier pattern of increased presence within your body.

### Hindrance Description

You forget your meditation object and that you are meditating, becoming completely lost within the mind created world of thoughts, memories or fantasies for a period of time.

Habitual forgetting occurs when mindfulness weakens, causing you to lose focus on your meditation object and forget that you are meditating. After some time, you may realize that you have become absorbed in a stream of thoughts, memories, and fantasies. This tendency to forget is a survival mechanism of the mind, developed to conserve energy by following established patterns of behavior, much like a screensaver on a computer.

It's important to understand that habitual forgetting is a natural function of the mind, rather than a personal flaw. This mental habit can be gradually deconditioned through skillful retraining and practice.

### Working with the Hindrance

To weaken the mental habit of habitual forgetting, once you are familiar with Skills 01-03, you can apply them to support this process:
1. Sit in meditation with your palms resting in your lap, one thumb gently resting on the other. This creates a reference point from which you can observe your mind wandering away from this touch, helping you remember your meditation practice.
2. Develop enjoyment of Mindful Presence of your body as in Skills 01-04. Gently soften your mental effort so that your awareness of the touch of your thumbs goes slightly out of focus. This will loosen your mind's grip on that sensation and allow your attention to habitually wander so that you can observe it.
3. Mind Wandering: If you notice a thought, memory, or fantasy arise in your mind but don't become lost in it, there's no need to do anything with it. Simply acknowledge its presence as something that occurred on its own (anatta) and continue to enjoy the relaxation and presence of your body. If you feel a slight pull of interest toward a thought, memory, or fantasy, simply soften the effort of your mind to let go of this interest, as described in Skill 02.
4. Habitually Forgetting: If you find yourself completely absorbed in a thought, memory, or fantasy, recognize its anatta nature and smile, rewarding your mind for returning to mindfulness. Then, apply the last two steps in the GOSS Formula: Soften > Smile. This will help shift your awareness back to your body, highlighting how pleasant it feels to relax and let go of mental distractions. Focusing on how nice it feels to let go will reward your mind, resetting your mindfulness of your body.

Reestablish your attention on the touch of your thumbs as your reference point and begin again from Step 3.

### Progression Map

Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.

At this stage of mindfulness of breathing, insight is developed by being curious about creating the conditions that support Marker 04: Content Presence, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 04: Habitual Forgetting.

The mental habit of forgetting your meditation object and becoming lost within mind wandering will gradually weaken with increased intimacy with the enjoyment of breathing in Markers 04-06, and a weakened version may still be present until the transition onto Marker 07 with increased calm of body, breathing and mind.

Meditative Hindrances (Hindrances to calm) -> Meditation Markers (Signs of deepening calm)
- 00: -> Diaphragm Breathing
- 01: -> Body Relaxation
- 02: -> Mind Relaxation
- 03: -> Mindful Presence
- 04: Habitual Forgetting -> Content Presence [CURRENT SKILL]
- 05: Habitual Control -> Natural Breathing
- 06: Mind Wandering -> Whole of Each Breath
- 07: Gross Dullness -> Breath Sensations
- 08: Subtle Dullness -> One Point of Sensation
- 09: Subtle Wandering -> Sustained Attention
- 10: Sensory Stimulation -> Whole-Body Breathing
- 11: Anticipation of Pleasure -> Sustained Awareness
- 12: Fear of Letting Go -> Access Concentration

It is important to note that although your focus is on weakening the Hindrance: Habitual Forgetting at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the above Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How does your body reflect your state of mind right now?"

### Learnings

- Your body directly and truthfully reflects your state of mind in the same way a lake reflects, without judgment, the mountain, clouds and sky
- If you feel mentally happy, you will also feel happiness in your body as a feeling of lightness, comfort and calm energy
- If you feel mentally averse and angry, you will also feel anger in your body as a feeling of hotness, tightness, tension, and upward-moving energy
- Your current state of mind can be observed by your body's reaction to it in terms of its elemental qualities: warmth, coolness, heaviness, lightness, hardness, softness, etc., and the feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness that surrounds it
- Checking in and observing these helpful reflections in your body during your day will help you to clearly see how you are relating to what is happening in your life at this time, allowing you to soften, relax and let it go if it is based on desire or resistance

### Steps

1. Ground: Gently soften and relax your body and mind to bring awareness into your body until you feel grounded and mindfully present (as in Meditation Skill 03)
2. Observe: Check in during the day and notice if you have lost peripheral awareness of your body. If you have, you will find that your mind has become caught up in some thought, fantasy, reaction, etc.
3. Soften: Take a few softening breaths to relax your body. Be mindful of your awareness returning to your body when you relax, and notice how nice it feels to re-establish a background mindful presence
4. Smile: Gently smile with your eyes and bring it to the pleasant feeling of being mindful in your body's presence. For a few moments, smile and encourage the enjoyment of it to grow, rewarding your mind for letting go. Let go of this presence and go about your day, checking in now and then and softening and smiling to re-establish it if your mind has forgotten your body

Practised in this way, following the GOSS Formula, your mind will gradually develop a positive habit of being mindful of your body during the day. At first, the periods of peripheral mindful presence of your body will be short, but gradually, the periods of mindful presence will increase, and habitual patterns of desire and aversion will weaken.

### Daily Tips

- Use simple reminders: Use a simple reminder, such as walking through a doorway, washing your hands, or having a cup of tea, to check in on how you feel
- If you feel stressed: If you are resisting something, you will likely notice physical sensations within your body, such as tension and tightness in your throat, chest, or abdomen; there will also be a feeling of unpleasantness or unease in the background. Taking slow, softening breaths in your belly to relax, as you learned in Meditation Skills 01 & 02, will lower your experience of this stressed feeling
- If you feel anxious: When you feel anxious, ground your awareness by feeling your feet touching the ground. You can also ground by gently squeezing one hand in the other to make you more present. Next, place your palms below your belly button and use slow, softening breaths in your lower abdomen, as you did in the previous meditation, to re-engage your diaphragm. Re-engaging your diaphragm with slow, belly breaths will help lower anxious feelings
- To carry this presence throughout your day, allow your body's mindful presence to shift into peripheral awareness, much like you would enable quiet, gentle music to rest in the background of your awareness while you move about your home

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 05: Natural Breathing when you become naturally aware of the experience of your body breathing and find enjoyment in the relaxation and presence of your body. You will also notice that at this stage, the length of time you forget what you are doing during meditation and become lost in thinking will start to shorten. The appearance of the experience of your body breathing is the sign that your mind is ready for Skill 05. If the experience of your breathing is unclear at this stage, it is a sign that you need to spend more time learning to relax your body and mind. The quieter you become through relaxation, the more sensitive your body will become to your breathing. It is important to note that mind wandering and forgetting you are meditating for short periods is normal at this stage of meditation, will still be present at this time and will not fully settle down until the maturing of Skill 06. If you are feeling stuck and can't experience any pleasant feelings in your meditation in Skill 04, it is okay to move on to Skill 05. If your body feels present, and as you relax, you become aware of the movement of breathing in your body, it is okay to move on to Skill 05. Since all Skills are various stages of calm in meditation, you will still be practising Meditation Skill 04 each time you meditate and will gradually develop enjoyment in meditation anyway. Think of this approach as being stuck in the mud with a four-wheel drive. We could sit in the mud and dig away, or we could take a run-off and use that momentum to get to the other side. Removing the goal and finding enjoyment in meditation again will gradually bring back the pleasant feeling of meditation on its own.

Subtitle: How to transform breath control into mindfulness of natural breathing
Duration: 30 minutes

> "Always mindful, they breathe in; mindful, they breathe out." — The Buddha, MN119

## Overview

As your body and mind relax, you will become aware of the gentle stretch and relaxation of your body as it naturally breathes. Finding enjoyment in the gentle stretch and relaxation of each breath as your body breathes will increase your mindfulness and teach your mind how to let go of control.

## Benefits

- This Meditation Skill will teach you how to be present with different experiences and situations within your life without the need to control them.

## Purpose

Train your mind to let go of breathing by finding the spiritual pleasantness of letting go, available in the natural flow of in- and out-breaths in your body to weaken any tendency of your mind to control your breathing.

- SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/user-677685629/midl-insight-meditation-skill-05-transform-habitual-control-into-natural-breathing-1

## Instructions

Your meditation is the same as Meditation Skill 04, except you now develop mindfulness of the experience of breathing as it naturally flows in and out of your body. At this stage of meditation, it is important to bring the enjoyment and happiness you developed in Skill 04 to find the same enjoyment in the experience of your body as it breathes.

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-04

Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-04, except you now add Steps 2-3 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.

### Step 2: Natural Breathing

As the feeling of relaxation deepens, you will start to become aware of the subtle movement of your body as it breathes, as a gentle stretch and a natural relaxation.

Wherever breathing is clearest to you is ok. Your task is to learn to find enjoyment in the stretch and relaxation of your body as it naturally breathes. Relax back into the peripheral awareness of your body and notice how your body senses the gentle movement of breathing on its own.

### Step 3: Enjoy Your Breathing

Increase your awareness of how nice the stretch and relaxation of your body feels as your body breaths. Smile into your breathing with your eyes, finding enjoyment in the simplicity of each breath.

Smiling with your eyes, really enjoying it, will increase the pleasant feeling found within each in and out-breath. Finding enjoyment in your breathing will help to settle the hindrances of forgetting, control and mind wandering.

### Step 4: Developing Insight into Control

Develop insight by observing and softening any tendency of your mind to control your breathing. Breath control appears as tightness, tension, and breathing that does not settle or calm down as the meditation progresses. If you suspect breath control, allow a slow breath out through your nose, then relax and wait for the breath to draw back in by itself.

GOSS: Ground --> Observe --> Soften --> Smile.
- Ground: Be aware of the experience of your body's natural breathing.
- Observe: Notice whenever your mind begins to control your breathing.
- Soften: Allow a gentle softening breath out through your nose and relax and wait for it to come back in to reset your breathing.
- Smile: Smile with your eyes into the pleasantness as the natural breath draws in back in again, by itself, to reward your mind for letting go of control.

## Tips

- Develop insight by observing and softening any tendency of your mind to control your breathing. Breath control is characterised by tightness, tension, and breathing that does not settle or calm down as the meditation progresses. If you suspect breath control, allow a slow breath out through your nose, then relax and wait for the breath to draw back in by itself.
- It is important to note that although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Habitual Control at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance. As you develop contentment and enjoy your meditation more, you will become more aware of the natural flow of breathing throughout your body; old habits of seeking pleasure may slip in and manifest as your mind controls and tightens your breathing. Recognising your mind's tendency to control something that doesn't need to be controlled, your breathing presents a fantastic opportunity for insight into how to be aware of experiences and let them be as they are.

## Obstacles

### Habitual Control

Habitual Control refers to the experience of your mind interfering with and changing the natural flow of your breathing. Meditators usually experience this as a tight and uncomfortable feeling in the breath. This grasping of the mind to control the breath appears as tightness, tension and unease. As long as your mind has a habit of controlling your breath, your ability to develop deeper calm and tranquillity will be hindered. It is also important to observe your mind control things in daily life, as your breathing during mindfulness of breathing will reflect this. See this as an opportunity to learn to let go, and you are already halfway there.

## Insight

- Marker: 05 - Natural Breathing
- Hindrance: 05 - Habitual Control
- Antidote: Developing your skill in allowing your body to sense your breathing, rather then focussing your attention in on it creates the conditions for Marker 05, and is the antidote for the Hindrance of Habitual Control. To do this, be playful with finding the right amount of effort it takes to allow your breathing to occur naturally without controlling it. To learn to be with your breathing without control, first take a few soft, relaxing breaths and allow your awareness to return to your body. This will withdraw some of the energy from your mind by slightly shifting your attention out of focus. Next, let a slow, gentle out-breath through your nose. Once the breath has finished, then relax and wait. Trusting that your brain will fire a signal and that your body will begin breathing again by itself. When the breath comes back in, allow it to draw back in by itself. As you become comfortable with this, start to be curious about the difference in experience between breathing freely, without control, and controlled breathing. Repeating this and enjoying the natural, uncontrolled breath will gradually decondition your mind's tendency to control your breathing.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How am I relating to my breathing right now? Am I controlling it or allowing it to flow naturally?"

### Learnings

- Tightness and tension will appear in your body if your mind is resisting something.
- Feelings of longing will appear in your body if your mind wants something.
- Emotions and feelings of pleasantness and unpleasantness are also reflections of your state of mind in your body. It is helpful to observe these experiences in your body to understand how you relate to things in your life.
- These MIDL techniques you are learning naturally integrate into daily life. During quiet times, you can bring this simple skill of being mindful of your breathing into your daily life to relax your body and refresh your mind. From the foundation of mindfulness of your body, you can start to observe how the experience of your body changes throughout the day as a direct reflection of your state of mind.
- To avoid altering your breathing patterns or producing strain, be mindful of your breathing only during organised, quiet times and not striving to be mindful of your breath throughout the day. A more effective meditation object for achieving insight throughout your day is an open, peripheral awareness of your body, which creates a more present reference point.

### Steps

1. Gently soften awareness into your body until it feels grounded, present, now.
2. Relax and allow your awareness of your body to shift to the background.
3. During quiet time, learn to tune into the flow of breathing within your body.
4. Smile into the pleasant feeling of letting go that occurs with each natural breath.

## Support Teachings

### Mindfulness, Clear Comprehension and Delusion

When referring to the experience of delusion in MIDL, we are talking about the observation of habitual delusion. Habitual delusion can be observed during seated meditation and in daily life as the gaps of unawareness between attention and inattention. The experience of habitual delusion is very distinct and seen after it has occurred, as the mind slips into a state of not knowing and then defaults to underlying habitual patterns and tendencies autonomously.

While we are in habitual delusion, we cannot know it; this is because one of the primary conditions for it to arise is awareness of awareness ceasing. We can observe that this has happened when mindfulness returns, as awareness of awareness rearises again. It is at this point when you realise that you have been lost in thought or fantasy for a while and didn't realise it until now. On reflection, we can see that we were completely immersed in thought, fantasy, or memory, acting and reacting habitually and that we had no idea what was going on at that time.

There is an answer to this problem, and that is the development of samadhi (unification of mind/collectedness) built out of the Seven Awakening Factors:
1. Mindfulness.
2. Curiosity.
3. Balanced Effort.
4. Meditative Joy.
5. Tranquillity.
6. Unification of Mind.
7. Equanimity.

The minimum Awakening Factors that need to be present for samadhi to create a gap in habitual delusion are mindfulness and curiosity. Each Awakening Factor added to samadhi will make a bigger gap in delusion and habitual patterns within the insight meditator's mind.

As meditative samadhi develops and becomes more stable, not only do the periods of habitual delusion shorten, and the mindfulness gap increase, but mindfulness also returns more quickly during seated meditation and daily life. It is only then that we truly begin to see how much time throughout the day we spend in a habitually deluded state, with our mind autonomously practising habitual patterns and our personality by itself.

Habitual delusion and thinking do not necessarily go hand in hand, though, for most of us, some sort of thought process will be present in the deluded state. Delusion can also be present in the habituated doing of activities with no awareness of that doing. In defining habitual delusion, the key component is a period of 'not-knowing': the loss of awareness of awareness. You will experience this as sometimes exiting these states of unknowing and having the feeling that you weren't there for that period. You had checked out and went somewhere...

To weaken habitual delusion, it is essential to define the difference in experience between being in a state of not knowing versus the experience of being mindfully present within your body. The Buddha talked of this as being aware of the presence and absence of (X). When we talk about being aware of our present experience or the experience of what we are doing now, we have, at the very least, sati-sampajanna: mindfulness + clear comprehension.

To be mindful means to keep in mind to remember your present experience within short-term memory. The experience of mindfulness is being aware of being aware of (X) over time without losing awareness of it. Clear comprehension and mindfulness work together, and without clear comprehension, it is difficult for mindfulness to develop insight. The purpose of clear comprehension is to clearly see the intimate, conditional relationships in the flow of experience. Observing in this way, you will see a flow of autonomous (anatta) experiences within your awareness.

By observing the anatta nature of conditioned relationships within the gaps in habitual delusion created by samadhi, you will begin to understand the habitual nature of your mind and body. With this insight, your mind will gradually become disillusioned with delusion and begin to incline toward the undeluded state, which is the pleasant spiritual vedana found in samatha. Creating gaps in habitual delusion, developing insight in them, and coming back again and again to the pleasure of relaxing and letting go found in samatha, the periods of delusion will become less and of samatha will increase. The GOSS Formula in MIDL helps this process to unfold.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress when, as a natural progression of relaxing & letting go, you move from being aware of each in and out-breath to being aware of the whole length of each in and out-breath without controlling it. It is important to note that it is only necessary to weaken habitual control at this stage, not to be completely free from it. If your mind, for example, causes your breathing to tighten so that it is difficult to breathe, then habitual control needs to be weakened before moving on. However, if while being aware of the breath, your mind calms down, a sign of this is being aware of the whole length of each breath, then it is perfectly ok to move on to the next stage in your meditation.

Duration: 40 minutes

> "Breathing in long, they know: 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, they know: 'I am breathing out long." — The Buddha, MN119

## Overview

As you enjoy the gentle stretch and relaxation of your body with each in and out-breath, your mind will develop intimacy with it. With this intimacy, the continuity of your mindful awareness will increase, allowing you to enjoy noticing the whole length of each in and out-breath.

## Benefits

- Improve your focus on your present task in daily life
- Reduce mind wandering throughout the day as you become more present in your body

## Purpose

Increase mindfulness and clear comprehension of the whole of each in- and out-breath as it naturally flows in your body, to shorten forgetting and mind wandering.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-05

Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-05, except you now add Steps 2-3 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy your body as it breathes.

### Step 2: Whole Length of Each Breath

As relaxation and enjoyment deepen, mindfulness of breathing will naturally transition from being aware of each in and out-breath in Skill 05 to being aware of the whole length of each breath, from its beginning to its middle to its end. This transition should not be forced but rather a natural progression of increased enjoyment and mindful curiosity.

To aid with this, I have found it helpful to picture each in and out-breath as one continuous breath that changes direction by not focusing on the gap between breaths.

### Step 3: Continue to Enjoy Your Breathing

As in Skill 06, increase your awareness of how nice each stretch and relaxation of your body feels. Smile into your breathing with your eyes, finding enjoyment in its simplicity.

Smiling with your eyes, really enjoying it, will increase the pleasant feeling found within each in and out-breath. Finding enjoyment in your breathing will help to settle the hindrances of forgetting, control and mind wandering.

### Step 4: Develop Insight into Mind Wandering and Gross Dullness

Mind Wandering: Take advantage of any wandering of your attention away from this grounding point to cultivate your perception of the autonomous, 'by itself' nature (anatta) of mind wandering. Apply the GOSS Formula below to train your mind to find more enjoyment in your meditation than in wandering thoughts or fantasies.

Dullness: Also, be attentive to any feelings of dullness growing in your peripheral awareness as your mind becomes more intimate with the experience of the whole length of each breath. At this stage of developing samadhi, it is easy to over calm the mind's ability to comprehend an experience clearly.

### Step 5: Adjust Your GOSS Formula

At this stage of meditation, make a simple adjustment to your GOSS Formula to weaken distraction.

GOSS Formula: Ground --> Observe --> Soften --> Smile.

- Ground: Be aware of the experience of the whole length of each breath.
- Observe: Notice whenever you become distracted from it.
- Soften: With gentle breaths, relax and become aware of the whole of each breath.
- Smile: Smile with your eyes, noticing how nice it feels to be present again to reward your mind for returning to the presence of your breathing.

## Tips

- As your samadhi deepens, it is essential to remain mindful of not becoming too mentally calm and allowing your awareness to become dull and unclear. Smiling with your eyes and bringing that smile to the subtle, pleasant feeling of each breath, really enjoying it, will keep Hindrance 07: Gross Dullness away.
- Although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Mind Wandering at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance.
- As you develop intimacy with each in- and out-breath, your mind will begin to enjoy your breathing, just as it did with Mindful Presence. As enjoyment with breath experience grows, your mind will become increasingly interested in the whole of each breath, from its beginning to the middle to the end.
- At this stage of meditation, it is essential to find enjoyment in the experience of your breathing. If you are not enjoying being mindful of each breath, your mind will replace it with something enjoyable, like thinking or fantasising. If this continues to go unnoticed, your mind will then slip back to Hindrance 04: Habitual Forgetting, causing your samadhi (unification of mind/collectedness) that you have developed so far to collapse.

## Obstacles

### Mind Wandering

Your mind finds distraction more enjoyable than your meditation object. Mind Wandering refers to your mind seeking something more entertaining than your meditation object. When this happens, your mind shifts a thought, memory, or fantasy to the foreground of your attention, and your meditation object, in this case, the breath, rests in the background awareness. If you do not maintain this awareness, your mind will become distracted and drop your meditation object from awareness, slipping back down to Hindrance 04: Habitual Forgetting.

This is the normal progression of Mind Wandering in mindfulness of breathing:

- Skills 00-03: Forgetting for long periods before mindfulness returns and being completely lost in mind-wandering is normal.
- Skill 04: The length of time you forget you are meditating and become lost in mind-wandering before mindfulness returns becomes shorter as Skill 04 matures.
- Skill 05: The length of time you forget you are meditating and become lost in mind-wandering before mindfulness returns continues to shorten as Skill 05 matures.
- Skill 06: The length of time you forget your body breathing during meditation continues to shorten until it ends with the maturity of Skill 06. On maturity, there are periods of mind wandering without forgetting, and your breathing remains in your awareness without forgetting it. Note: mind wandering will still be present but the time distracted by it is shortening.
- Skill 07-08: Because of the growing calm and calming of the intellectual mind, mind wandering occurs for short periods before awareness returns to breath sensation. During mind wandering at this stage, the breath sensations remain within your peripheral awareness and are not forgotten; you are simply partially distracted by them.
- Skill 09: As Skill 09 matures, mind wandering changes to flickering of attention toward thoughts, then background thoughts, then a mind free from thoughts as attention sustains on breath sensation.

## Insight

- Marker: 06 - Whole of Each Breath
- Hindrance: 06 - Mind Wandering
- Antidote: Developing your skill in cultivating intimacy with and enjoyment of your body breathing, to create the conditions for Marker 06, is the antidote for the Hindrance of Mind Wandering. In dealing with the wandering of your mind, sometimes you will find that your mind wanders to thoughts, memories, or fantasies that are very sticky in nature. This means that your mind has difficulty letting them go. These are opportunities for deeper insight. Sticky thoughts, memories and fantasies weaken by observing responses within your body, such as tensing or emotions, until you can experience the underlying pleasantness or unpleasantness. Applying the GOSS Formula by softening and relaxing the effort held within your mind and body toward these distractions while finding enjoyment in letting them go re-grounds awareness within your body and rewards your mind for letting them go.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "Am I aware of the whole length of each breath?"

### Learnings

- Gently soften awareness into your body until it feels grounded, present, now.
- Relax and allow your awareness of your body to shift to the background.
- During quiet time, learn to tune into the flow of breathing within your body.
- Become aware of the whole length of each breath as it passes one point within your body.
- Feel the subtle pleasantness of each letting go that occurs with each natural breath.

### Steps

1. To avoid altering your breathing patterns or producing strain, be mindful of your breathing only during organised quiet times, and not striving to be mindful of the breath throughout the day.
2. A more effective meditation object for achieving insight throughout your day is an open, background awareness of your body, which creates a more present reference point.

## Progression

Criteria: You find enjoyment in being aware of the whole length of each breath in & out-breath, without effort and without habitually forgetting your meditation object (the breath) and feel confident in your ability to settle any mind wandering by applying the GOSS Formula when it occurs. Mind wandering does not completely stop at this stage of meditation and will continue in more subtle forms until Skill 09 when your attention sustains. As your mind and body relax and mindfulness develops, the time your mind wanders will shorten. It is how quickly you notice that your mind has wandered from your breath and body, and mindfulness returns that is most important here.

## Overview

As your body, breathing, and mind calm, you can now begin to relax the habitual wandering of your attention. In MIDL we do this by shifting the focus of attention from the whole length of each breath, to resting on the experience of breathing at the tip of our nose.

## Benefits

- This Meditation Skill will teach you how to increase your focus on the present task by developing calm within your mind rather than through effort.

## Purpose

Increase mindfulness and clear comprehension of the elemental qualities of breath sensations to increase calm and remove the conditions for gross dullness.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-06

Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-06, except you now add Steps 2-4 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.

Additions for developing Breath Sensations in Skill 07:

### Step 2: Calm your body, breathing and mind

As your awareness settles on the whole length of each breath for a period of time without distraction in Skill 06, begin to relax any final effort you feel in your body, breathing and mind to develop calm. Relaxing and allowing the remaining effort to dissipate through these three stages while tuning into how nice it feels will bring a sense of calm to your body, breathing, and mind.

As your body, breathing, and mind calm, allow your attention to rest on the sensations of each breath at the tip of your nose while maintaining a 30% peripheral awareness of your whole-body breathing.

### Step 3: Tune into the elemental quality of each breath

Tune into the flow of sensations as air enters and leaves your nose and divide those sensations into elemental qualities as the breath comes in and goes out. Begin by experiencing them separately, clarifying one before moving onto the next.

- Coolness & warmth: First, notice the feeling of coolness in your nose with each in-breath, changing into warmth with each out-breath.
- Pressure: Once this is clear, notice the changing feeling of pressure within your nose and head with each in and out-breath.
- Wetness & dryness: Then increase mindfulness by being aware of the subtle feeling of dryness on each in-breath and moistening on each out-breath.
- Breath length: When comfortable with these previous three, start to notice how each in and out-breath changes direction.

### Step 4: Enhance your enjoyment in the growing calm

As your mind becomes interested in the elemental qualities within each breath, it will begin to withdraw energy from your intellectual mind. As your intellectual mind relaxes the experience of over calm will begin to grow. You can enhance your enjoyment of the feeling of calm by gently smiling with your eyes toward it and allowing yourself to appreciate it.

## Tips

- To transition from Skill 07 to Skill 08, you will calm your mind's perception of breath length by calming your mind's perception of time.
- Gross Dullness is a rite of passage for the insight meditator. It occurs during mindfulness of breathing when we become skilled in samadhi (unification of mind / collectedness) but are not yet competent in balancing it with clear comprehension. Be vigilant and develop an understanding of how your mind gradually dulls as samadhi in mindfulness of breathing develops. Learn to counter this dullness by arousing curiosity, finding enjoyment in letting go and increasing the clarity of your comprehension of the elemental experience of your meditation objects.
- It is important to note that although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Gross Dullness at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the above Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance. As you develop intimacy with the length of each breath, and the level of calm increases in your body, breathing and mind, it is easy to become too calm and lower the ability of your mind to be aware of any experience. The complete dulling of awareness is a sign of progress in meditation and a rite of passage for all insight meditators. It is essential to understand that your mind does not instantly become grossly dull; it is a gradual process of conditions that lead up to it. By becoming sensitive to the gradual dulling of your mind from Skill 01: Body Relaxation and increasing the detail of your noticing up to Skill 09: Breath Sensation, Gross Dullness will not arise within your mind.

## Obstacles

### Gross Dullness

Gross Dullness refers to the experience of an extreme lowering of your ability to be aware of any experience. This is experienced as a loss of clarity in both your mind and your meditation object. Gross Dullness is a sign of progress in meditation and reflects the deepening of a meditator's samadhi (unification of mind).

Gross Dullness occurs as the meditator develops physical and mental relaxation, and they inadvertently over-calm the ability for awareness to know an experience. Gross Dullness (sinking mind or sloth & torpor) is a rite of passage for the meditator. It refines the meditator's skill in relaxing while maintaining a clear comprehension of their present experience. As you learn to balance the effort, the Awakening Factor of Right Effort will mature, and you will no longer experience gross dullness. If not addressed, Gross Dullness will weaken your samadhi and cause your mind to slip back to Hindrances 06: Mind Wandering, 04: Habitual Forgetting, and then, if really strong, Hindrances: 03: Sleepiness & Drifting, 02: Mental Restlessness and 01: Physical Restlessness will manifest.

## Insight

- Marker: 07 - Breath Sensations
- Hindrance: 07 - Gross Dullness
- Antidote: Become familiar with and apply the antidotes in the article: Working with Dullness.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "Am I tuned into the elemental qualities of breath sensations at the tip of my nose?"

### Learnings

- Gently soften awareness into your body until it feels grounded, present, now.
- Relax and allow your awareness of your body to shift to the background.
- During quiet time, learn to tune into the flow of breathing at the tip of your nose.
- Tune into the changing sensations at the tip of your nose while softening your effort to do so.
- Feel the subtle pleasantness of letting go that occurs with each natural breath.

### Steps

1. To avoid altering your breathing patterns or producing strain, I recommend being mindful of sensations at the tip of your nose only during organised quiet times, and not striving to be mindful of the breath throughout the day.
2. A more effective meditation object for achieving insight throughout your day is an open, peripheral awareness of your body, which creates a more present reference point.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress when you feel confident in your ability to remove the conditions supporting Gross Dullness before it arises, and you clearly perceive the changing elemental qualities of your breathing at the tip of your nose without effort or strain and without forgetting them.

## Overview

While smiling, allow the growing feeling of pleasantness, joy, and tranquillity to unfold. Your mind will become deeply calm, and attention will naturally rest on a single point of breath sensation, clearly aware of sensations at that point while maintaining peripheral awareness of your whole body.

## Benefits

- Bring stability and calm to your mind
- Shift attention from habitual negativity to positive, wholesome qualities during your day
- Direct your mind toward developing qualities of benefit, like love, kindness, gratitude, generosity, etc.

## Purpose

Calm the intellectual functions of your mind and remove subtle dullness by relaxing the perception of time and increasing the clarity of breath sensation.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-07

Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-07, except you now add Steps 2-3 as new additions to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.
- Enjoy growing calm and intimacy with breath sensations.

### Step 2: One-point breath sensation

As your perception of time fades in Marker 07, your awareness of breathing happening over time will fade, leaving one point of changing breath sensation at the tip of your nose. It is important not to try to make this happen but rather to fade your mind's interest in time by really enjoying what is happening now.

When your attention rests on one point of breath sensation, tune into the changing flow of those sensations at that one point while keeping a 30% awareness of the subtle movement of your body breathing in the background. This will prevent subtle dullness from developing.

### Step 3: Increasing feeling of tranquillity

As the seclusion of your mind increases due to low sensory stimulation, the experience of calm will grow into tranquillity as an open, unmoving stillness.

Gently smile with your eyes and bring that smile to the pleasant feeling of the growing tranquillity, allowing it to fill your background awareness while maintaining your attention on the changing sensation at the tip of your nose.

## Tips

- As you develop intimacy with the sensation within the length of each breath at the tip of your nose, the experience of calm and tranquillity of your mind will grow. Due to increasing calm and tranquillity, your mind's perception of time will begin to fade, and so will your perception of the length of each breath. This is experienced as attention becomes steady and firm on the one point of breath sensation.
- Due to increasing tranquillity, it is easy for curiosity to become too low, causing mindfulness to weaken. This can be observed as an increased clarity of mind, yet a loss of clarity of the sensations at the tip of the nose.
- Once you understand how to calm mental activity while increasing mental energy, the clarity of breath sensations will increase, and the continuity of attention will become steady yet effortless. When this develops, you are ready to develop Marker 09: Sustained Attention.

## Obstacles

### Subtle Dullness

Subtle dullness refers to the experience of the disappearance of your ability to perceive sensations within your breathing (or meditation object). While Gross Dullness is defined as dullness in both your meditation object and mind, Subtle Dullness is defined as an increased dullness in your meditation object while still maintaining clarity of your peripheral awareness. While experiencing subtle dullness, your mind will be clear, lucid, and tranquil. Because of this, it is easy to be deluded into thinking that you have entered an absorption state. If not addressed, this experience will repeat, and you will not reach more refined levels of samadhi (unification/collectedness of mind), and grosser hindrances will start to arise again, causing your samadhi to weaken.

## Insight

- Marker: 08 - One Point of Sensation
- Hindrance: 08 - Subtle Dullness
- Antidote: Developing your skill in cultivating increased clarity of breath sensations plus increased awareness of your body experience in the background creates the conditions for Marker 08, and is the antidote for the Hindrance of Subtle Dullness. To prevent subtle dullness from occurring, increase your curiosity and develop samatha (relaxation, calm) from the beginning of your meditation. At Marker 07, increase the detail of the elemental qualities within each breath. When you reach Marker 08, aim to increase the clarity of the sensations at the tip of your nose. Arousing enjoyment by smiling with your eyes toward the growing feeling of pleasantness, of growing calm and tranquillity, will aid in keeping your mind's interest and removing all dullness from your mind.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "Am I aware of one point of breath sensation with clarity?"

### Steps

1. Gently soften awareness into your body until it feels grounded, present, now.
2. Relax and allow your awareness of your body to shift to the background.
3. During quiet time, learn to tune into the flow of breathing at the tip of your nose.
4. Tune into the changing sensations in one point of contact while softening your effort.
5. Feel the subtle pleasantness in each letting go that occurs with each natural breath.

### Tips

- To avoid altering your breathing patterns or producing strain, be mindful of your breathing only during organised quiet times, and not striving to be mindful of the breath throughout the day.
- A more effective meditation object for achieving insight throughout your day is an open, peripheral awareness of your body, which creates a more present reference point.

## Progression

Criteria: As a natural progression of letting go, you become aware of your attention resting on one point of breath sensation. Awareness of those sensations is clear to you, and there is a distinct experience of unmoving tranquillity in peripheral awareness. Due to the immaturity of meditative joy and tranquillity, there will still be some subtle wandering and restlessness within your attention. These two hindrances will calm in Meditation Skill 09: Sustained Attention by increasing enjoyment & tranquillity.

## Instructions

### Your Meditation So Far

- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.
- Enjoy tranquility and intimacy with one point of sensations.

### Step 1: Mindful Presence

Develop Markers 01-03 purely by relaxing and letting go with a clear comprehension of the experience of it. This experience can be divided into three areas:
- The experience of elements in your body.
- The pleasantness of how nice it feels to relax and let go.
- The increased awareness of your body develops as you relax effort in your body and mind.

Meditate by relaxing and letting go to develop mindfulness and balanced effort.
- Develop your skill in transitioning between Markers 01-03: M01: Body Relaxation > M02: Mind Relaxation > M03: Mindful Presence by taking your time to clearly comprehend and enjoy the subtle pleasantness of relaxing and letting go.
- Observe how these three Markers establish the first three Awakening Factors of mindfulness, curiosity & balanced effort.

When you are comfortable developing Markers 01-03 by relaxing and letting go with a clear comprehension of the enjoyable experience of presence, you can include Step 2.

### Step 2: Content Presence

Meditate by relaxing and letting go to develop contentment and meditative joy.
- Develop your skill in transitioning from Marker 03-04: M03: Mindful Presence > M04: Content Presence by taking your time to clearly comprehend and enjoy how nice it feels to be content and to abide mindfully in your body.
- Observe how developing contentment in Marker 04: Content Presence begins to establish the fourth Awakening Factor of Meditative Joy by uplifting your mind with the spiritual pleasant feeling that comes from feeling content and satisfied.

When you are comfortable developing Markers 01-04 by relaxing and letting go with a clear comprehension of the enjoyable experience of contentment, you can include Step 3.

### Step 3: Calm Abiding

Meditate only by relaxing & letting go to develop calm abiding.
- Develop your skill in transitioning from Marker 05-07: M05: Natural Breathing > M06: Whole of Each Breath > M07: Breath Sensation by taking your time to clearly comprehend and enjoy the subtle pleasantness of growing calm within your body, breathing and mind.
- Observe how, as calm develops, it also calms the fourth Awakening Factor: Meditative Joy, as the conditions for the fifth Awakening Factor: Tranquillity develop.

When you are comfortable developing Markers 01-07 by relaxing and letting go with a clear comprehension of the enjoyable experience of calm, you can include Step 4.

### Step 4: Tranquillity & Seclusion

Meditate by relaxing and letting go to develop meditative joy and tranquillity.
- Develop your skill in transitioning from Marker 07-08: M07: Breath Sensation > M08: One Point of Breath Sensation by taking your time to clearly comprehend and enjoy the subtle pleasantness of growing tranquillity & seclusion.
- To do this, gently smile into the pleasantness of growing tranquillity & seclusion while clearly comprehending the changing elemental qualities within the breath sensation. (You can replace breath with the touch of your thumbs if preferred). Enjoy the subtle pleasant feeling of the growing tranquillity while calming any desire 'to do' your attention. Gradually, the focus of your attention will stabilise on the one point of breath sensation.

### Step 5: Increase Stability

Continue gently softening your mental effort to calm all 'doing' within your mind. As your mind continues to calm by finding enjoyment in the growing tranquillity and seclusion, your attention will become effortlessly stable on one point of breath sensation. When effortless stability occurs, maintain silent, stable attention on one point of breath sensation.

### Step 6: Sustained Attention

When your attention becomes very stable, it no longer flickers to thoughts or other sensory experiences. Allow your attention to rest on that one point and perceive the beauty & subtle pleasantness in the experience of growing tranquillity.

As the stability of your attention matures, it will sustain the breath-sensation and stay there by itself. This is experienced as a shift from effort to effortlessness. This shift is very distinct. Sustained means that attention effortlessly, by itself, rests on one point of breath sensation at the tip of your nose, while maintaining a 20% peripheral awareness of your whole-body breathing. Peripheral awareness is like music playing in the background at a dinner party, enjoying it but not focusing on it.

## Tips

- Meditate only by Letting Go: At this stage of meditation, it is essential to learn how to transition between Markers 01-09 in mindfulness of breathing, not by 'doing' each Marker, but rather by allowing them to arise as a natural progression of relaxation and letting go, with clear comprehension. As you relax and let go, take an interest in how the development of Markers 01-09 establishes the first Five Awakening Factors: mindfulness, curiosity, balanced effort, meditative joy, & tranquillity.
- At this stage of meditative skill, your mind will naturally begin to move between Markers quickly due to the momentum of letting go in your heart and mind. This transition can be so fast that you may not notice all of the markers. It is essential to follow the momentum of letting go that is present within your heart and mind. For example, you may move straight into Marker 03: Mindful Presence as soon as you sit in meditation. You may then move from there to sensations at the tip of your nose in Marker 07. Next, you find that your mind no longer wanders, and your attention sustains on one point at Marker 09: Sustained Attention. Skipping over Markers without effort is a natural sign of the mind's progression toward samatha as the hindrances weaken.
- For some meditators, as samadhi develops, the clarity of experiencing sensations in their breathing may start to fade and even disappear. This is not due to subtle dullness as in Skill 08 but rather because of the increased unification of samadhi. If your attention is no longer wandering and your breath sensation disappears, keep your attention resting on that one point. As you do your breathing pattern will shift into effortlessness, and the breath-sensation will reappear. If it doesn't and your attention is no longer wandering, opening your awareness to your whole-body breathing, as in Skill 10, will re-establish the experience of breath sensation throughout your body. As long as your attention is freed from habitual wandering and your intellectual mind has calmed down, you have achieved the purpose of Skill 09.

## Obstacles

### Mental Dryness Due to Too Much Tranquillity

A rite of passage for many meditators at this stage of mindfulness of breathing is entering into a very still, calm state of mind that is exceptionally peaceful, with nothing happening. In this state, the experience of your body and breathing will fade, as well as your ability to access the joyful feeling of piti-sukha. If you have experienced this at Skill 09, you have entered into mental dryness due to too much tranquillity.

Try developing devotion toward the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, and carry that devotion into your mindfulness of breathing. This devotion, saddha (verified faith), will create the conditions for meditative joy and, therefore, piti-sukha to arise and allow it to continue through the whole of your meditation. The absence of the Awakening Factor of piti-sukha will prevent you from progressing to Meditation Skills 10-12.

The first thing to acknowledge when you find yourself caught in dry tranquillity is that this tranquil state is positive in terms of the Awakening Factors. The problem isn't the tranquillity; it is that your tranquillity is high, which is a good thing. However, everything creates causes and conditions, including the overdevelopment of tranquillity. Just as earlier-developed relaxation and calm meditators can end up in dullness due to over-calming their knowing ability when developing tranquillity, meditators can over-calm meditative joy and enjoyment. As tranquillity develops, it calms the intellectual functions of the mind, including the function of interest and caring toward what is being experienced. This removes the conditions for meditative pleasure and the ability to find enjoyment, causing both of these to fade from your mind gradually.

The trick is to uplift your mind with meditative pleasure and enjoyment while calming the intellectual functions of your mind. This can be done by:
- Enjoyment: Making the enjoyment of your meditation stronger before developing tranquillity in Skills 08-09, by intentionally finding enjoyment in the growing seclusion of calm and tranquillity. Be curious about and make a firm intention to enjoy the pleasure of relaxing and letting go of the sensory world.
- Saddha: Try developing strong devotion toward the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha and carrying that devotion into your mindfulness of breathing.
- Loving-Kindness: Try switching to metta, loving-kindness, as your main practice for a time, until joy becomes strong and stable.
- Gratitude: Bring more gratitude into your meditation and life by intentionally bringing your awareness to what is right about this present experience rather then what is wrong.

## Insight

- Marker: 09 - Sustained Attention
- Hindrance: 09 - Subtle Wandering
- Antidote: Developing your skill in cultivating effortless and stable attention in Marker 09, is the antidote for the Hindrance of Subtle Wandering. Developing your skill in accessing the enjoyment of letting go within each of the Markers by relaxing and developing intimacy with each one. It is important to note that the conditions for accessing spiritual pleasantness & enjoyment are dependent on your mind letting go. Every day, cycles of mental clinging based on feelings of attraction and aversion will affect your ability to sustain your attention. Curious observation and refinement of sila (morality), combined with taking it easy in daily life while reducing sensory stimulation and distraction, will make meditative joy more accessible during meditation.

Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.

Insight is developed at this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about creating conditions that support the stability of Marker 09: Sustained Attention at the tip of the nose, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 09: Subtle Wandering.

Subtle Wandering refers to the experience of little flickering movements of your attention away from your meditation object during meditation. Flickering of attention is observed at this stage because of deep relaxation and letting go of control. This is simply habitual scanning of your attention towards your six sense fields that occurs because you are no longer controlling your mind. When Subtle Wandering is present, you may have thoughts and other distractions arising in your peripheral awareness. Still, they do not draw the focus of your attention from your meditation object. As samadhi deepens, this flickering will naturally calm and come to an end for the period of the meditation by itself.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How can I use meditative joy to observe attraction and aversion in my daily life?"

Your understanding of accessing meditative joy can be applied to your daily life as a way of observing attraction and aversion, as the fading of joy occurs when these emotions are present. Since the factors of softness, meditative joy, and tranquillity are cultivated by tuning into the pleasantness of letting go, any habitual grasping of your mind throughout the day will cause this pleasure to collapse.

### Steps

1. Soften, relax and allow awareness to enter your body.
2. Allow this peripheral awareness to shift to the background.
3. Smile into and enjoy this mindful presence to arouse joy.
4. Develop sensitivity to meditative joy within your mind.
5. Use meditative joy to observe your mind during the day.
6. Gently smile with your eyes to re-establish it when it weakens.
7. Tune into the arising pleasant feeling of this return & letting go.
8. Smile into and encourage this joy to grow within your mind.

## Progression

Criteria: When your attention no longer wanders from your meditation object and effortlessly sustains (rests) on one point of breath sensation. There will still be sensory experiences and (might be) thoughts in the background, but they no longer draw your attention away from your meditation object. You will still have sensory experience within your peripheral awareness, including some fleeting thoughts, but your attention will no longer move out to them.

> "They train themselves: 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' They train themselves: 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body'." — The Buddha, MN119

## Overview

As you become skilled in developing tranquillity, you no longer need to practice Skills 07-09. From Skill 06: Whole of Each Breath, you will now gradually become more aware of the pleasurable experience of your whole body as it breathes in Skill 10, to withdraw awareness from the six sense fields.

## Benefits

- This Skill will teach you to develop calmness and non-reactivity to sensory experiences so that your mind is less disturbed by stimulation throughout the day.

## Purpose

Withdraw peripheral awareness from your six sense fields to increase mental seclusion in preparation for access concentration and jhana (wholesome absorption).

## Instructions

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-06

Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-06, except you now move directly to Skill 10 once tranquillity is developed and add Steps 2-3 as new additions to your meditation. You will know when enough tranquillity has developed because your mind will become tranquil as mind wandering calms, and awareness will become clear as dullness is removed from your mind.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.
- Add: Enjoy the pleasure of your whole body as it breathes.

### Step 2: Breathing throughout Your Body

From being aware of the whole length of each breath in Skill 06, begin to open your awareness to the experience of breathing throughout your body. As your awareness of the entire breath increases, begin to calm your body, breathing, and mind until the felt sense of calm deepens. As you stay with the whole length of the breath, enjoying it and becoming intimate with it, the calm will develop into tranquillity. This will be correlated with a decrease in mind wandering and an absence of the hindrance of forgetting.

### Step 3: Whole Body Breathing

Gradually increase your awareness of your entire body as it breathes until you experience breathing throughout your whole body, simply inclining towards whole-body awareness, where the breath and the body are intimately sensed together.

## Tips

- Increased intimacy with the subtle pleasure of your whole-body breathing will withdraw your awareness from the stimulation of your six senses. As sensitivity to your senses fades, body-breathing will transition from a physical meditation object in Skill 10 to a mind-created one in Skill 11, taking the experience of piti-sukha as an object.
- You may experience shaking in your attention as you transition from sustained attention to peripheral awareness of your whole body as it breathes. This may occur due to a weakness in your ability to open your awareness, allowing you to take in many experiences as one within a single field of that awareness. This is like looking over a valley and taking in the whole view rather than focusing on one thing within that view.

## Obstacles

### Sensory Stimulation

Sensory Stimulation refers to the subtle, habitual grasping of the mind onto sensory experiences within the peripheral awareness during meditation. This subtle habitual sensory grasping disturbs the unification of the mind because of the dispersal of mind energy and, therefore, hinders the development of upacara samadhi (access concentration).

## Insight

- Marker: 10 - Whole-Body Breathing
- Hindrance: 10 - Sensory Stimulation
- Antidote: Developing your skill in cultivating intimacy with your whole body as it breathes in Marker 10, is the antidote for the Hindrance of Sensory Stimulation. The antidote to sensory stimulation is to become aware of breathing within your body part by part, as described in the above meditation instructions. Once you are aware of breathing throughout your body, you create a strong intention to be fully present in this experience. With this intimacy, you will begin to experience a fading of your sensory fields, including the body sense, with bodily pleasantness replacing sensations within your body. When your mind develops intimacy with this bodily pleasantness, this instability will come to an end.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "How is your awareness of whole-body breathing developing?"

### Learnings

- Progression in mindfulness of breathing can be accurately tracked by observing your ability to access the Meditation Markers. This can be done by developing insight into their associated Meditative Hindrances and changing the conditions that support them.
- Insight is developed at this stage of mindfulness of breathing by cultivating intimacy with breathing throughout your body, creating the conditions for Marker 10: Whole-Body Breathing, and weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 10: Sensory Stimulation.
- After developing intimacy with Marker 06: Whole of Each Breath, your meditation will naturally transition to the experience of Marker 10: Whole-Body Breathing. This transition occurs because your skill in calming the conditions that support Hindrances 00-09 improves when you sustain attention in Meditation Skill 09. As intimacy with whole-body breathing increases, awareness of your five senses will begin to fade, and the pleasantness of your whole-body breathing will fill your awareness.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress to Meditation Skill 11: Sustained Awareness when you become intimately aware of the experience of your whole-body breathing as a pleasurable breath experience, and your awareness of your five physical senses begins to fade (viraga).

- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.
- Enjoy the pleasure of your whole body as it breathes.

Additions for sustaining your awareness in Skill 11:
Your meditation remains the same; Steps 2-3 are two new additions to your meditation

### Step 2: Intimacy with pleasantness

As your experience of your sense fields fades, so will your experience of sensations within your breath-body. As your mind enters a state of seclusion from sensory stimulation, it will experience a sense of relief, and the sensations within your body will be replaced by pleasurable feelings that reflect this enjoyment of letting go. What will remain is the pleasurable, blissful feeling of piti throughout your breath-body and the joyful happiness of sukha within your mind and heart. The mind-created pleasurable experience of piti is now your meditation object.

### Step 3: Sustained awareness

Continue to increase your intimacy with the pleasurable feeling of piti, allowing awareness to experience it from within. Continue until awareness enters an autonomous flow, accompanied by a feeling of blissful pleasantness. This is experienced as the transition between effort and effortlessness.

At this stage, awareness has begun to sustain with the pleasurable blissful sensation (piti). Your awareness will begin to feel steady, stable and unmoving. Remain with this enjoyable, blissful feeling and offer it your complete, undivided attention. As you do, your strength and clarity will increase.

Allow your awareness and attention to unify in the foreground, focusing on the pleasantness of your whole-body breathing (piti), and let sensory experiences fade into the background, allowing for peripheral awareness.

## Tips

- As you become more aware of the experience of breathing throughout your whole body, you will find that your awareness begins to develop an intimacy with it. Intimacy of awareness refers to the exclusivity of attention you give to someone you care about, letting them know how much you care, free from any external distractions. As the intimacy of your awareness of whole-body breathing increases, the boundaries of your body and the sensations within it will fade. This is not a sign of dullness, as your mind at this stage is beyond it, but rather an observation of the gradual shutting down of the body's sensory doors because your mind no longer gives importance to them. This same process is happening to your other senses, but because of your exclusive awareness of your body, it will not be as obvious.
- Most importantly, your mind senses are also undergoing a calming process because they are no longer being stimulated. As this happens, they will gradually enter a state of pleasure and seclusion. This pleasure cannot be understood in terms of worldly pleasure, which seeks and wants more, but rather the joy of letting go, putting down, and releasing. As your mind enters a state of seclusion from sensory stimulation, it will experience a sense of relief, and the sensations within your body will be replaced by pleasurable feelings that reflect this enjoyment of letting go.
- It is important to note that although your focus is on settling the Hindrance of Anticipation of Pleasure at this stage of meditation, all the other Hindrances listed above may also be present. It is essential to settle each Hindrance in the order presented in the above Map for Mindfulness of Breathing, as each Marker is the antidote for its associated Hindrance. As you increase intimacy with the pleasantness of your body-breath experience, your awareness will begin to withdraw from the six sense fields. As your body is one of the five physical senses, as its sensitivity fades, the borders of your body and sensations within your body will also fade away. As sensation sensitivity fades, all that will be left is a refined pleasurable feeling of piti, replacing the body-breath with the joyful happiness of sukha in the background. This piti-sukha is now your meditation object to develop the final step before jhana, access concentration.

## Insight

- Marker: 11 - Sustained Awareness
- Hindrance: 11 - Anticipation of Pleasure
- Antidote: Developing your skill in cultivating intimacy with the feeling of pleasantness of your body as it breathes is the antidote for the Hindrance of Anticipation of Pleasure. Anticipation of Pleasure in your meditation will naturally calm as your mind becomes more intimate with the enjoyable aspects of your present experience. Repeated exposure to the pleasantness of your meditation and the blissful, piti feeling that arises will cause your mind to be no longer excited by it. You can further weaken the Hindrance of Anticipation of Pleasure by refining contentment in all aspects of your life. Increasing intimacy with the pleasantness of your whole body as it breathes will withdraw all energy from craving and allow awareness to sustain itself in access concentration.

## Progression

Criteria: When you become aware of an increased feeling of steadiness of awareness accompanied by fading of the sense fields and the sensations in your body fade, leaving an increasingly pleasurable, blissful feeling (piti) and joyful happiness (sukha) that fills the experience of your awareness.

## Benefits

- This Meditation Skill will teach your mind to incline toward and absorb into wholesome (kusala) pleasure in daily life by releasing interest in habitual identification with hindrances and increased disenchantment with sensory stimulation.

## Purpose

To develop your skill in reaching and resting in access concentration in preparation for the first pleasure jhana.

## Instructions

### Preparation: Access Concentration

- Refine your sila (morality) in daily life.
- Incline your mind toward the kusala (wholesome/skilful).
- Calm the desire for sensory pleasure using GOSS.
- Find relaxation, calm and ease as you move around.
- Cultivate and become skilled in the first six Awakening Factors.

### Step 1: Meditation Skills 01-11

Your meditation remains the same as in Meditation Skills 01-11, except you now add Step 2 as a new addition to your meditation.

Your Meditation So Far:
- Sit in meditation.
- Reflect gratefully.
- Enjoy relaxing your body and mind.
- Enjoy being content & present in your body.
- Enjoy the whole of each breath as your body breathes.
- Enjoy the pleasure of your whole body as it breathes.
- Enjoy the pleasantness of piti within your body and mind.

### Step 2: Access Concentration

Continue to increase your minds intimacy with the pleasurable feeling of the piti throughout your body until your samadhi (unification of mind) enters into an autonomous flow with the pleasantness of this experience. As you do, your awareness and attention will merge to become steady, firm, effortless, unmoving, and free from distraction and hindrances, like looking through a still, clean glass window.

Once your mind is unified and stable on the experience of the pleasantness of the piti for at least 15 minutes without any effort or distraction, free from all hindrances, you have reached access concentration (upacara samadhi).

## Tips

- If tranquillity and letting go are mature at access concentration, piti will be calm and unexcited with sukha dominant. If tranquillity and letting go are immature, then piti may arise as quite strong waves of blissful, pleasant feelings that disturb the tranquillity and, at times, are unpleasant.
- As your mind's intimacy with the blissful, pleasant feeling (piti) grows, it will begin to fill the whole of your awareness, and the joyful happiness (sukha) will grow. With this wholesome quality as the object of awareness, all fear of letting go of control will vanish, and your awareness will incline into and rest in this pleasurable feeling of piti and sukha.
- The feeling of piti can vary for everyone and can range from very subtle to a strong flow that shakes or bounces your body. Once all hindrances are suppressed from your mind due to samadhi at Skill 11, the pleasant feeling of piti within your body will grow in strength. If tranquillity is high enough, the experience of piti will be quite beautiful, bringing a natural smile to your face and a feeling of happy joy to your mind.
- As your samadhi matures, sensory stimulation will fade in your awareness. Your mind will begin to replace sensory stimulation with mind-created experiences. A light may appear in your visual field, like someone has opened the curtains and let light into the room. You may even see flickering lights in front of your eyes. This is a direct reflection of the strength of your samadhi and the seclusion of your mind from the six sense fields.
- Once you are comfortable reaching access concentration and resting in it, focus on developing the speed at which you can reach it during mindfulness of breathing. It is important to continue developing mindfulness of breathing based on a momentum of letting go, rather than effort so that an inclination toward letting go increases within your mind.

## Obstacles

### Fear of Letting Go

Fear of Letting Go refers to the deeply seated fear of giving up control to the momentum of letting go within your mind. Like a child on a slide, even though previously excited, once they gain momentum, fear arises within their mind, and they hang on. In the same way, the meditator's mind, feeling the uncontrollable nature of entering the flow state that is the doorway to jhana, becomes tense with fear and clings to the sensory world.

### Unstable Samadhi

Unstable samadhi is overcome in this final stage in three parts:

1. Progressive clarity: Progressively increase the clarity of the Meditation Markers while samadhi develops in mindfulness of breathing. Be careful not to rush through each Marker, instead develop stability in it by allowing each Marker to reveal itself naturally.

2. Finding Enjoyment: To find enjoyment in the simplicity experienced within each Marker, it is essential to adopt the correct mental attitude when you sit down to meditate. Not one that is based on striving or expectation, but rather one of finding enjoyment and contentment with the simplicity of meditation itself. This can be enhanced by gently smiling with your eyes into how nice your present experience feels.

3. Softening effort (letting go): Learn to transition through the Markers by finding enjoyment of the natural unfolding of mindfulness of breathing by softening and letting go rather than by 'doing' your meditation.

## Insight

- Marker: 12 - Access Concentration
- Hindrance: 12 - Fear of Letting Go
- Antidote: Developing saddha: faith, confidence, and trust in the Buddha, your teacher, and your meditation community is the key to letting go (vosagga). Develop trust in the Buddha, your teacher, your community and the Dhamma. A helpful reflection is: "I am not the first to walk this path; others have walked it before me". Mature the depth of your contentment in seated meditation and all aspects of life. Repeat your exposure to the growing blissful, pleasant feeling until your mind develops disenchantment towards it so that all anticipation and fear drops away.

## Daily Application

Check-in: "Am I curious about completely calming 'all doing' in my mind to create the conditions for access concentration?"

### Learnings

- Insight is developed at this stage of mindfulness of breathing by being curious about completely calming 'all doing' in your mind to create the conditions for Marker 12: Access Concentration, thereby weakening the conditions that support Hindrance 12: Fear of Letting Go.

### Six Characteristics of Access Concentration

1. There will be an initial pleasant feeling or tingling in your body and mind. The first sign of the conditions for access concentration starting to develop is that your mind will no longer wander from your meditation object, and you will begin to feel a feeling of pleasantness growing in your body and mind (piti) around Skill 09. Piti arises as the mind begins to enjoy being secluded from sensory stimulation and the hindrances. Initially, you may experience piti as a pleasant sensation in your forehead, face, chest, or hands. Some meditators feel it in their legs or spine as an upward-moving, pleasurable energy.

2. Your mind will have no interest in sensory pleasure. The second sign of the conditions for access concentration developing is that your mind will no longer have any interest in experiencing anything other than your meditation object, and it will incline toward the pleasure and enjoyment of letting go. As your mind inclines away from sensory experience, the sensations in your body and the borders of your body will completely fade away. All that will remain is the experience of pleasant piti within your awareness, with the happiness of sukha and an awareness of sound being far away in the background.

3. There will be no hindrances present within your mind. The third sign is that your samadhi (unification or collectedness of mind) will be strong enough to suppress all hindrances from your mind. This means that your mind becomes so unified and intimate with your meditative experience that there is no room within it for any hindrance to be present. The presence of thinking in the background, anticipation, fear of letting go or doubt are signs that your samadhi is not yet stable enough to suppress the hindrances.

4. Your mind will switch from applied to sustained attention. The fourth sign is the effort of focus your attention (vitakka) on your meditation object dropping away. A sign that effort has dropped away is that keeping your meditation object in mind becomes effortless and autonomous (vicara) as your mind takes over the application of awareness (vitakka) to your meditation object, itself.

5. Your attention and awareness will feel unified, steady and firm. The fifth sign of access concentration developing is when the previous conditions come together as your samadhi matures, and awareness and attention merge as one. This is experienced as your awareness becoming steady, firm, effortless, unmoving, and free from distraction and hindrances, like looking through a still, clean glass window.

6. There will be an absence of any desire 'to do' or 'doer' within your mind. The sixth sign is that, after samadhi has matured, there will be no longer a desire 'to do' and a complete absence of a 'doer', making the unification of the samadhi feel effortless and desireless. You will no longer feel like you are 'doing' your attention or awareness, and your mind will begin to flow with the experience of a pleasurable feeling of piti that arises within the awareness of your body and mind.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress when you are comfortable developing access concentration and can remain in it for at least 15 minutes with the pleasant feeling of piti remaining stable within the awareness of your body without fading. Congratulations, you have finished Cultivation 04.

Duration: 60 minutes, 2-3 times daily, to give your mind time to absorb into piti and abide in the first pleasure jhana. This stage requires a simplification of your life, adherence to sila (morality) and inclining your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful).

> "Secluded from the desire for sensory experience, secluded from unwholesome qualities, a meditator enters and dwells within the first jhana, with applied and sustained attention, blissful feelings in body & mind, and joyful happiness born of seclusion." — The Buddha, MN119

## Overview

As your samadhi reaches access concentration in Skill 12, you continue to develop intimacy with the pleasantness of the experience of piti within your body and mind, until your mind takes it as an object within your samadhi and flows with and absorbs into it to enter the first pleasure jhana.

## Benefits

- Regularly entering and experiencing the first pleasure jhana will weaken your mind's attraction to extracting pleasure from worldly experiences (including thinking) and develop an inclination of your mind toward the spiritual pleasure that is only available through letting go of desire for worldly sensory pleasure.

## Purpose

Unify in access concentration on the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti of your whole-body breathing, and allow the feeling of joy and happiness of sukha to rest in peripheral awareness.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Develop access concentration as in Meditation Skill 12

"Secluded from the desire for sensory experience, secluded from unwholesome qualities." As in Meditation Skill 12, continue to increase your mind's intimacy with the pleasantness of the piti experience throughout your whole body as it breathes until you develop initial access concentration.

### Step 2: Allow the pleasant feeling of piti throughout your body to grow

It is important to allow any feeling of piti to grow naturally through letting go and not to be tempted to do anything to try to increase it at this early stage. Once you can rest in access concentration for at least 15 minutes and a clear experience of pleasant piti feeling is present in your body, you can begin to develop the conditions for the first pleasure jhana.

### Step 3: Rest awareness on the clearest pleasant feeling of piti in your body

When the pleasant feeling of piti is clear and continuous in your body, rest your attention on the place in your body where the pleasant feeling is most clear to you. Focus your attention on the clearest pleasant feeling in your body and allow your mind to absorb the pleasantness of the pleasant feeling.

### Step 4: Be aware of the pleasant feeling of the piti and let it be

At first, nothing may happen. The pleasant feeling may intensify suddenly then weaken again. Simply be aware of it and let it be. Any attempt to do anything will cause the piti to fade. Your only task is to develop stable attention on the pleasant piti feeling.

### Step 5: Allow your mind to absorb into the pleasantness

At some point, the feeling of pleasantness will gradually increase in strength and clarity. Allow your mind to experience and enjoy the pleasantness of the piti until your mind enters an autonomous flow with the pleasantness of the experience. When the conditions are right, the pleasantness will start to enter your mind. Take in the experience like you would take in a beautiful view. Let the pleasant feeling fill your mind. Since your mind creates pleasant feelings when it is happy, it will start to produce more pleasant feelings. This creates a feedback loop of pleasant feelings between your body and mind.

### Step 6: Allow your mind to enter the First Pleasure Jhana

The pleasant piti feeling will gradually grow and flow through your mind and body, filling your awareness. When mature, your awareness will autonomously absorb into and flow with this experience. You may experience a shift as your awareness 'sinks into' the flow of blissful pleasantness or as the flow expands and surrounds your awareness. Regardless of how you experience it, it will be clear that an autonomous experience has occurred and a definite shift in consciousness has taken place. When this happens, your mind has entered the first pleasure jhana.

Once absorbed, you will have a blissful, pleasant sensation flowing through your body and mind. This may be a flow that fills all parts or a flow shooting up your spine. The blissful pleasant feeling brings a smile that doesn't want to go away, and an uplifting feeling of joy in your mind and open happiness in your heart (sukha).

### Step 7: Pervade your body and mind with the experience of piti and sukha

"A meditator permeates and pervades, saturates and fills their body with blissful feelings and joyful happiness born of seclusion, so that there is no part of their entire body that is unpervaded by blissful feeling & joyful happiness."

As the blissful energy of the first pleasure jhana settles down, expand your awareness outward until no part of your body and mind remains untouched by the pleasant piti feeling. Keep practicing accessing the first pleasure jhana. Gradually your mind will become desensitized to the piti feeling and begin to incline toward the more subtle experience of sukha. When sukha comes to the foreground of awareness and piti fades into the background, your mind is inclining toward the second pleasure jhana.

## Tips

- Play around with where you experience the pleasant piti feeling most clearly. Using the MIDL technique, maintain a continuous, heartfelt smile through your eyes. This brings up a clear, pleasant sensation around your eyes and forehead. Some meditators experience clear pleasant feeling in their chest, heart centre, or in their hands. Some report experiencing it in their legs or spine as an upward-moving, pleasurable energy. Wherever you experience the pleasantness of piti is ok; the important part is to let it be and enjoy its presence.
- This is the important part - not doing anything. When you first bring your awareness to the pleasant piti feeling, nothing may happen. The thought that nothing will happen may come up and stop anything from happening. Any anticipation of jhana at this stage will cause the whole thing to collapse. Remember, anticipation is one of the hindrances to access concentration and jhana. It is a matter of learning how to maintain access concentration sustained enough to suppress hindrances and how to calm your mind so that it can be with the pleasant piti feeling without needing to do anything with it.
- Any attempt to help the piti grow will reengage your intellectual mind and collapse the pleasant-feeling feedback loop. It is the pleasantness of the piti that the mind flows with and absorbs into. Allow your mind to rest in and absorb the pleasantness of the feeling, enjoying it.
- Once in access concentration, learn to bring the joyful happiness of sukha to the foreground of your awareness and relax your interest in the pleasant feeling of piti, so that it rests in peripheral awareness. This is done by allowing loud music at a party to fade into the background so it doesn't disturb your conversation. This shifting withdraws some of the energetic quality from the piti, allowing the focus to shift to subtler experiences of tranquillity and sukha.

## Obstacles

### Watch out for anticipation & fear

At this stage, be careful of the last two meditative hindrances: The anticipation of experiencing pleasure (H11) and The fear of letting go of control (H12). These will cause your attention to bounce out of access concentration. Remember it is okay; it is part of the learning process.

### When piti is too strong

For some meditators, piti may become very intense, making mind and body shake. If your mind keeps bouncing in and out of the first pleasure jhana because piti is too strong, there are a couple of techniques: (1) Learn to develop access concentration by letting go of control of your attention and experiencing meditation through your body; (2) At access concentration, incline your mind toward the joy and happiness of sukha rather than the pleasantness of piti to calm your mind's grasping onto pleasure.

## Progression

Criteria: You are comfortable developing and abiding in the first pleasure jhana for longer periods, and your mind is inclining away from the stimulation of piti toward the subtler happiness of sukha.

Cultivation: 04 - Pleasure Jhana & Equanimity
Subtitle: How to transform blissful pleasure into joyful happiness through refined sukha
Duration: 60 minutes, 2-3 times daily, to give your mind time to absorb into sukha and abide in the second pleasure jhana. This stage requires a simplification of your life, adherence to sila (morality) and inclining your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful). Organised Buddhist meditation retreats create the perfect conditions for accelerating your practice from this point.

> "With the calming of applied & sustained attention, the meditator enters & dwells within the second jhana, with inner calming & unification of mind, free from thinking & reflection, and filled with blissful feelings in body & mind and joyful happiness born of unification." — The Buddha, MN119

## Overview

As the experience of the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti calms, intimacy with the joyfulness of mind and happiness of heart (sukha) increases, until your mind flows with and absorbs into it as it enters the second pleasure jhana.

## Benefits

- Regularly entering and experiencing the second pleasure jhana will strengthen your mind's ability to abide in the joyful presence of sukha throughout your day and create an open happy heart of joyful presence as a foundation for the spiritual happiness of the wholesome kusala qualities of gratitude, loving kindness, compassion, generosity, and gentleness in thought, speech and action.

## Purpose

Unify in the uplifting experience of joyfulness of mind and happiness of heart (sukha), with the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti significantly calmed and resting in your background peripheral awareness.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Develop Access Concentration and Deepen Contentment

To cultivate the conditions for the second pleasure jhana, begin by developing a deeper experience of contentment, enjoyment and tranquillity during mindfulness of breathing, by taking your time experiencing each Marker as it arises. Once your mind reaches access concentration as in Meditation Skill 12, allow your samadhi to become firmer and effortless by inclining your mind toward the joy and happiness of sukha rather than toward the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti in your body.

### Step 2: Absorb into piti for First Pleasure Jhana

Enter the first pleasure jhana as you did in Meditation Skill 13 and stay within it until its energetic feeling settles down, all thinking is absent, and you mind begins to incline toward a feeling of joyfulness and happiness as your mind has a sense of becoming more stable and unmoving.

### Step 3: Incline your mind toward the joyfulness and happiness of sukha

The key to moving from the first pleasure jhana to the second pleasure jhana is to shift your interest from the blissful, pleasant feeling of piti to the less stimulated feeling of the joy and happiness of sukha. I recommend doing this by noticing the uplifting feeling of sukha present in the background while in the first pleasure jhana, and then shifting the feeling of piti into the background by softening your interest in it.

To aid in the shift from the first pleasure jhana to the second pleasure jhana, calm your mind's application of attention (vitakka) by softening effort and interest within your mind. As vitakka calms, you will experience your mind as being firm, steady, unmoving on the feeling of joy and happiness of sukha, tranquil and free from any possibility of thinking or doing. You will know you have entered the second pleasure jhana when the feeling of restlessness and stimulation due to vitakka is absent.

### Step 4: Absorb into the experience of sukha to enter the second pleasure jhana

Once sukha is your foreground experience, allow your attention to rest on it and gently stay focused on it, as you did with piti in the first pleasure jhana. Sukha will grow in clarity, and piti will fade into the background. Allow the experience of sukha to begin to flow within your mind. If piti begins to grow again, incline your mind away from the pleasurable experience of piti and toward a feeling of contentment with the growing stability and seclusion of your mind. As you do, your mind will gradually absorb the joyful feeling of sukha into it, and a bubbling flow of happiness will arise from your heart, and your mind will wrap around and immerse itself fully in this flow. When your mind has completely let go of overstimulation of piti and flows with and absorbs into the happiness of sukha, your mind will enter the second pleasure jhana.

### Step 5: Pervade your body and mind with sukha

"A meditator permeates & pervades, saturates & fills their body with blissful feelings and joyful happiness born of unification, so that there is no part of their entire body that is unpervaded by blissful feelings & joyful happiness."

To stay longer in the second pleasure jhana, focus on the feeling of happiness flowing out of your heart's centre, bringing awareness to your heart's centre and allowing joy and happiness to flow. To pervade this feeling throughout your body, expand your awareness to all parts of your body and mind, allowing the pleasant piti feeling in the background and the happiness of sukha flowing from your heart to pervade it. Allow your mind to become unified, firm and tranquil on the experience of piti and sukha.

### Step 6: Practice moving between the first and second pleasure jhana

It is beneficial to learn how to transition between the first and second jhana. To move back to the first pleasure jhana, shift the focus of your mind to the background pleasant feeling of piti, and rest your attention on it until the piti grows and fills the whole of your mind experience. You can then practice moving to the second pleasure jhana in the same way as earlier, by shifting the focus of your mind to the now background experience of the joy and happiness of sukha.

When you play with this in this way, you will notice a very distinct difference between these pleasure jhanas by practising these transitions. In particular, the grossness of the experience of piti in the first pleasure jhana compared to the tranquility of the second pleasure jhana, in terms of energy and seclusion, will become clear. Like moving from the sounds of nature to a rock concert and back again, the first jhana will appear energetic, compared to the subtlety of the second. Start to experiment with this shift between foreground and peripheral awareness until you can make the pleasant feeling of the piti less intense simply by calming the application of attention towards the piti by your mind.

In this way, you will learn to differentiate the two pleasure jhanas and sustain attention within the second jhana for more extended periods. Once you can remain sustained in samadhi on the experience of the second pleasure jhana, you can then learn to spread that feeling of joy and happiness of sukha until it fills your whole body, like being draped in a clean light or cloth.

## Tips

- The blissful, pleasant feeling of piti in the first pleasure jhana comes from growing seclusion of your mind from the six senses. The experience of sukha in the second pleasure jhana comes from further withdrawing of the mind from stimulation and a sense of unmoving stability due to increased intimacy with unification of the mind itself. Softening your mind's interest in the stimulation of the blissful, pleasant piti feeling will allow the experience of piti to rest in the background. Enjoying the less stimulated feeling of sukha will bring it to the foreground and make the joyfulness of your mind and the happiness in your heart (sukha) your main meditation object for the second pleasure jhana with a more refined pleasant feeling of piti in the background.
- As your mind enters the second pleasure jhana, you will notice some distinct changes. The blissful, pleasant feeling of piti will still be present but will fade into the background due to inattention. Sukha will become your mind's main experience in the foreground. This will increase the feeling of calm in your mind and body that was absent in the first pleasure jhana. You will still be able to experience piti in the second pleasure jhana, except now it will be experienced as subtle, pleasant sensations in the background with an increasing stability in the experience of joy and happiness at the forefront of your mind. The experience of this can be described as an increased steadiness and firmness of your mind in samadhi, with upwelling, flowing happiness coming from your hearts centre as it opens.

## Progression

Criteria: You are comfortable developing and abiding in the second pleasure jhana for more extended periods, and your mind is inclining away from the excited quality of the joyfulness and the bubbliness of happiness of heart (sukha), toward a deeper, more still quality of happiness and contentment of heart.

Cultivation: 04 - Pleasure Jhana & Equanimity
Subtitle: How to transform joyful happiness into equanimous contentment
Duration: 60 minutes, 2-3 times daily, plus developing a continuity of contentment in your daily life is beneficial. The third pleasure jhana requires a simplification of your life, adherence to sila (morality) and inclining your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful). Organised Buddhist meditation retreats create the perfect conditions for accelerating your practice from this point.

> "With the fading of joy & piti, equanimous, mindful, with clear comprehension, experiencing the pleasure of happiness within the body, they enter & dwell within the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones say: 'Equanimous & mindful, they have a pleasant abiding'." — The Buddha, MN119

## Overview

As the bubbly happiness of the Second Pleasure Jhana subsides, awareness rests in the subtler feeling of happy contentment, and your mind, losing interest in the uplifting feeling of joyfulness, flows with and absorbs into the feeling of happy contentment, entering the Third Pleasure Jhana.

## Benefits

- Entering and abiding in the deep contentment and unmoving samadhi of the third pleasure jhana during seated meditation will create the conditions for maturing all Seven Awakening Factors once you finish seated meditation. This will allow you to develop deep insight after seated meditation and in your daily life.

## Purpose

Unify in the foreground in the subtle experience of happiness and contentment in your heart's centre, and allow the uplifting experience of joyfulness of mind to fade in the background peripheral awareness.

## Instructions

The third pleasure jhana is characterised by very still, unmoving awareness due to complete absorption into the heartfelt feeling of happy contentment. To create the conditions for the third pleasure jhana, spend more time developing contentment during meditation and daily life.

### Step 1: Spend more time deepening samadhi in access concentration

When establishing access concentration, spend more time resting in it and avoid rushing to enter the first pleasure jhana. In preparation for the third pleasure jhana, stay longer in access concentration until your samadhi becomes very firm and unmoving, and the experience of sukha, as an uplifting, joyful happiness, comes to the forefront of your awareness.

### Step 2: Develop and absorb into the first pleasure jhana

Develop the first pleasure jhana, as you did in Meditation Skill 13, by focusing attention on a clear, pleasant feeling of piti in your body. When the conditions are right, the wholesome, pleasant feeling of piti will gradually grow and flow through your mind and body, filling your awareness. When mature, your mind will autonomously absorb and flow with this experience. When this occurs, your awareness has shifted the sensory world to the first pleasure jhana.

When you access the first pleasure jhana, the blissful, pleasant experience of piti will be subtler due to the increased sukha developed in access concentration, and your mind will quickly go through the first pleasure jhana because of this inclination of your mind to rest in the second pleasure jhana.

### Step 3: Develop and absorb into the second pleasure jhana

Develop the second pleasure jhana, as you did in Meditation Skill 14, by focusing attention toward a clear, pleasant feeling of sukha (happiness of heart or joyfulness of mind) in your heart and mind. Once sukha is the foreground experience in your awareness, allow it to rest there and grow. The pleasant feeling of piti will gradually fade into the background due to inattention, and the happiness and joyfulness of sukha will become the dominant experience due to the focus of your mind toward it.

As your experience of sukha moves to the foreground, gently rest your awareness in this experience and allow it to flow within your awareness. Your awareness will gradually absorb the joyful feeling, and a flow of happiness from your heart will arise to enter the second pleasure jhana.

### Step 4: Learn to separate sukha into joyfulness of mind & happiness of heart

As the pleasant feeling of piti fades, becoming very subtle in the background in the second pleasure jhana, you will notice that sukha is comprised of two parts: an uplifting joyfulness of mind and a bubbling happiness flowing from your heart. Once this becomes clear, you can separate these two by seeing the grossness of the joyfulness and by inclining your awareness toward calming the energetic quality of the bubbling feeling of happiness.

### Step 5: Rest awareness on the feeling of happiness, bringing it to the foreground

Begin to calm the energetic quality of the happiness of heart by gently softening your interest in it and inclining your mind toward a deeper feeling of contentment within your body. Allow your awareness to rest more deeply in your body, and as you do this, the energy of joyfulness will calm, leaving a feeling of happy contentment of heart, which will begin to fill your foreground experience as content grows, becoming still and unmoving.

### Step 6: Allow your mind to absorb into the third pleasure jhana

Allow your mind to rest in and flow with the feeling of happy contentment in your heart's centre. Your mind will gradually absorb into the flow, and there will arise the experience of a complete absorption of your mind. The experience of this will be entering a subtle, deeply calm, happy contentment of heart that is free from any sense of movement and completely still.

The experience of the third pleasure jhana is one of vast stillness, being deeply serene, tranquil, peaceful, unmoving contentment that is deeply satisfying, with an extremely clear clarity of mindfulness with clear comprehension of just these qualities of the third pleasure jhana.

### Step 7: Pervade your body and mind with the satisfying feeling of happy contentment

Expand awareness to all parts of your body and mind, allowing the pleasure of feeling deeply happy and content to pervade them until they become steady, firm, and unmoving in samadhi. When your mind enjoys this pleasure of the happy feeling of contentment, it will become unmoving, still and tranquil. Equanimity towards the subtle pleasant feeling still present in the third pleasure jhana will start to arise within your mind as samadhi matures and your mind inclines toward the fourth pleasure jhana.

## Sutta Reference

"Furthermore, with the fading of blissful feelings in body & mind, the meditator dwells equanimous, mindful & clearly comprehending, experiencing happiness in their body. In this way, they enter & dwell in the third jhana, of which Noble Ones say: One who is equanimous & mindful has a pleasant abiding."

"They permeate and pervade, saturate and fill their body with happiness free from blissful feelings."

"Just as lotuses growing in a pond may stay immersed in the water without breaking the surface and still flourish, they are permeated and pervaded, saturated and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips so that no part of them is unpervaded by it."

"In this way, a meditator permeates and pervades, saturates and fills their body with happiness free from blissful feelings, so that no part of their body is unpervaded by this happiness."

"And as they remain heedful, ardent, and resolute, memories and resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning, their mind gathers and settles inwardly, grows unified and collected." — The Buddha, Kaya-Gata Sati Sutta, MN 119

## How to Use Jhana to Develop Sotapanna-Insight

As soon as you begin developing your skill in the third pleasure jhana, you can start developing insight into anicca and anatta at the end of each seated meditation session.

Sotapanna (Stream Entry) is the first of four mature insights leading to the experience of Nibbana that will permanently uproot specific fetters (that which binds) from your mind. The first three fetters removed through insight are:

- Attachment to view of permanent self (uprooted through insight into anicca and anatta)
- Hindrance of doubt (uprooted through saddha/verified faith)
- Attachment to rites & rituals (uprooted through insight into idappaccayata: specific conditionality)

### Reason for Developing Pleasure Jhana Before Sotapanna-Insight

The reason for developing the samatha jhanas up to the fourth pleasure jhana is that they create the conditions for all Seven Awakening Factors to develop and remain within the meditator's mind after seated meditation in preparation for Sotapanna-Insight. The pleasure jhanas are the easiest way to do this in daily life and also in a retreat setting. Developing pleasure jhana based on a momentum of letting go during mindfulness of breathing and a foundation of enjoyment of mindfulness of your body has the added benefit of weakening the hindrances within your mind before developing jhana. This particular way of training your mind during insight meditation enhances the conditions for the complete letting go of all experience and experiencing necessary for Sotapanna-insight.

### Creating Conditions for Sotapanna-Insight from Third Pleasure Jhana

You can begin to create the conditions for Sotapanna-Insight from the third pleasure jhana onwards by sitting in meditation and developing and absorbing into the third pleasure jhana for the period of your meditation. Remain seated for a while after you finish meditation and be curious about the fading of the jhana factors from your mind and the re-arising of the engagement of your mind with your six sense fields as your mind emerges from jhana and you enter your day. You can enhance this insight by precise investigations into the anatta (autonomous nature) and idappaccayata: specific conditionality of all experience and experiencing.

### Seven Awakening Factors

1. Mindfulness
2. Curiosity
3. Balanced Effort
4. Meditative Joy
5. Tranquillity
6. Unification of Mind
7. Equanimity

During mindfulness of breathing, you developed the first six Awakening Factors once you established samadhi in access concentration. As you entered the pleasure jhana you gradually abandoned Awakening Factors to reach deeper states of letting go in jhana.

### Awakening Factors in the Third Pleasure Jhana

- Mindfulness
- Balanced Effort
- Tranquillity
- Unification of Mind

### Rebuilding the Awakening Factors for Insight

Accessing the third pleasure jhana requires letting go of the Awakening Factors of curiosity and meditative joy. To develop insight after your meditation and during the day, you need to reestablish the second and fourth Awakening Factors. The conditions for the seventh Awakening Factor, equanimity, can be developed from the third pleasure jhana by integrating periods of continuous noticing in a retreat environment to develop khanika samadhi (momentary unification) to a jhanic level.

#### Step 1: Arouse Curiosity

When your mind emerges from the third pleasure jhana, arouse the Awakening Factor of curiosity within your mind by taking an interest in and observing the fading of the jhana factors and the rearising of the interaction between your mind and sensory experiences. Be curious about the anicca (impermanent) and anatta (autonomous) nature of the jhana factors. Once your mind has reengaged with the sensory world, turn toward the anicca and anatta nature of the coming and going of sensory experience.

#### Step 2: Arouse Meditative Joy

Once curiosity is present within your mind, apply a quality of pleasurable interest in observing the rearising of the interaction between your mind and sensory experiences and appreciating the continuing seclusion of your mind from stimulation that remains. Gently smiling with your eyes will enhance the uplifting experience of joyfulness in your mind.

#### Step 3: Optional - Develop Equanimity with Khanika Samadhi

You can still develop deep insight in Step 4 after emerging from the third pleasure jhana but having the Awakening Factor of equanimity present will significantly increase your insight into anatta and idappaccayata: specific conditionality.

The conditions for the seventh Awakening Factor: Equanimity can be cultivated outside of samatha jhana, and requires long periods of continuous noticing of the arising and passing of fine sensory input. Combining this with long sitting periods, to develop momentum in khanika samadhi (momentary concentration), makes accessing the fourth vipassana jhana possible. An unstimulated retreat environment is most suitable for this level of khanika samadhi to the jhanic level, and a commitment to continuous mindfulness and noticing throughout the day.

#### Step 4: Loosen up Your Samadhi

When you emerge from the third pleasure jhana, your mind will still be so unified in samadhi that there will be no space for anything to arise. In order to develop insight into anicca and anatta, you need to loosen up your mind's unification so that it can switch to khanika samadhi (momentary unification) for vipassana-insight. Observing the anatta nature of your mind and experiences requires swapping from samatha-based unified attention to vipassana-based momentary unification. Re-establishing a background mindful presence of your body will create a foundation from which you can develop deep insight into anatta and idappaccayata: specific conditionality.

## Progression

Criteria: The experience of happiness and pleasantness in the third pleasure jhana gradually becomes more refined and subtle, and the quality of contentment fills the foreground of your awareness, transforming into equanimity as the conditions for the fourth pleasure jhana develop.

Duration: 60 minutes, 2-3 times daily, plus developing continuity of equanimity in daily life. This stage requires a simplification of your life, adherence to sila (morality) and inclining your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful). Organised Buddhist meditation retreats create the perfect conditions for accelerating your practice from this point.

> "Furthermore, with the abandoning of sukha & dukkha, as with the previous passing away of happiness & unhappiness, a meditator enters & dwells in the fourth jhana, which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant and contains mindfulness purified by equanimity." — The Buddha, MN 119

## Overview

As happiness of the third pleasure jhana calms, your mind, resting in neutral contentment, free from happiness and pleasant or unpleasant feelings, will flow with and absorb into an extremely quiet, serene stillness, with clear mindfulness and unmoving equanimity, entering the fourth pleasure jhana.

## Benefits

- Entering and abiding in the deep equanimity and unmoving samadhi of the fourth pleasure jhana will create the conditions for your mind to mature all Seven Awakening Factors when you finish seated meditation and develop deep vipassana insight in your daily life.

## Purpose

Unify in the foreground with the experience of neutral contentment, free from happiness, free from pleasant or unpleasant feelings, while allowing happiness and pleasure to fade into your background, peripheral awareness.

## Instructions

The Fourth Pleasure Jhana is a tranquil, serene stillness characterised by clear, on-looking mindfulness and unmoving equanimity. To create the conditions for it, you must simplify your life, adhere to a code of Sila (morality) that leads to harmony, and incline your mind toward that which is kusala (wholesome/skilful).

### Step 1: Spend more time deepening samadhi in access concentration

The fourth pleasure jhana requires a deeper and more unified samadhi than the third pleasure jhana. To prepare your mind for the fourth pleasure jhana, develop skills in accessing and dwelling in access concentration for extended periods so that the samadhi in access concentration has time to deepen. When establishing access concentration as in Meditation Skill 12, spend more time resting in it and avoid rushing to enter the first pleasure jhana. In preparation for the fourth pleasure jhana, stay longer in access concentration until your samadhi becomes very firm and unmoving.

Signs that access concentration has deepened are the absence of the five physical senses, and that the scope of your awareness becomes bright. The experience is like sitting in a dark room, and someone opens the curtains, with the sunlight shining through your eyelids. Your mind will become very still and bright as samadhi matures, and your mind will be free from hindrances and sensory stimulation. Using your meditation time to learn to reach access concentration faster, and abiding in it for more extended periods before entering jhana, will aid in developing the amount of samadhi needed to make accessing the fourth pleasure jhana easier.

### Step 2: Develop the third pleasure jhana as you did in Meditation Skill 15

Develop the third pleasure jhana as you did in Meditation Skill 15. The experience of the third pleasure jhana is one of vast stillness, being deeply serene, tranquil, peaceful, content and deeply satisfied, with an extremely clear clarity of mindfulness with clear comprehension of just these qualities.

### Step 3: Learn to separate the feeling of happiness from contentment

As you become fluent in the third pleasure jhana, and dwell in it regularly, it will mature in steadiness of contentment, and the strength of equanimity of your mind will gradually increase. This is experienced as a growing neutrality and disenchantment of heart toward the refined happiness and pleasure accessed within the third pleasure jhana. As neutrality deepens, so will the depth of contentment, equanimity and the firmness of the unmoving stillness of the samadhi present.

### Step 4: Allow your mind to absorb into the fourth pleasure jhana

As neutrality and contentment of heart further deepen, your mind will become disenchanted with the doing of the doer and you will notice it incline in equanimity toward all experience and experiencing. Gently rest your mind on the experience of equanimity plus unmovingness and allow it to fill your foreground experience, with any remnants of pleasantness & happiness fading into the background. Continue to incline toward complete neutrality, relaxing back any interest in experiencing or doing until your awareness flows with and absorbs into this experience.

With the experience of mature equanimity in the fourth pleasure jhana, there will be no disturbance, unmoving steadiness, full clarity of comprehension, and complete seclusion from all sensory input with a clear, still quiet, purity of mind, and complete continuity of mindfulness being your dominant experiences.

### Step 5: Pervade your body and mindfulness with equanimity

Expand and allow the experience of the purity and unmoving equanimity to pervade the whole of your experience so that no part of your experience is unpervaded by it. Allow this experience to become steady, firm, and unmoving in samadhi, enjoying the complete seclusion from sensory stimulation and all doing.

## Sutta Reference

"Furthermore, with the abandoning of sukha & dukkha, as with the previous passing away of happiness & unhappiness, a meditator enters & dwells in the fourth jhana, which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant and contains mindfulness purified by equanimity."

"They sit, pervading their body with pure, bright awareness. The same as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that no part of his body was untouched by this white cloth, a meditator sits, pervading their body with pure, bright awareness so that no part of their body is unpervaded by pure, bright awareness."

"And as they remain heedful, ardent, and resolute, memories and resolves related to the household life are abandoned, and with their abandoning, their mind gathers and settles inwardly, grows unified and collected." — The Buddha, Kaya-Gata Sati Sutta MN 119

- Unification of Mind
- Equanimity

### Rebuilding the Awakening Factors for Insight

To develop insight after your meditation and during the day, you need to reestablish the second and fourth Awakening Factors. The advantage of the fourth pleasure jhana is that when your mind emerges, you will have the seventh Awakening Factor of equanimity present within your mind.

### Steps

1. Arouse Curiosity: When your mind emerges from the fourth pleasure jhana, arouse the Awakening Factor of curiosity within your mind by taking an interest in and observing the fading of the jhana factors and the re-arising of the interaction between your mind and sensory experiences. Be curious about the anicca (impermanent) and anatta (autonomous) nature of the jhana factors. Once your mind has reengaged with the sensory world, turn toward the anicca and anatta nature of the coming and going of sensory experience.
2. Arouse Meditative Joy: Once curiosity is present within your mind, apply a quality of pleasurable interest in observing the rearising of the interaction between your mind and sensory experiences and appreciating the continuing seclusion of your mind from any stimulation that remains. Gently smiling with your eyes will enhance the uplifting experience of joyfulness in your mind.
3. Loosen up Your Samadhi: When you emerge from the fourth pleasure jhana, your mind will still be so unified in samadhi that there will be no space for anything to arise. In order to develop insight into anicca and anatta, you need to loosen up your mind's unification so that it can switch to khanika samadhi (momentary unification) for vipassana-insight. Observing the anatta nature of your mind and experiences requires swapping from samatha-based unified attention to vipassana-based momentary unification. Re-establishing a background mindful presence of your body will create a foundation from which you can develop deep insight into anatta and idappaccayata: specific conditionality.
4. Maintain Equanimity: Maintaining equanimity outside of samatha jhana requires long periods of continuous noticing of the arising and passing of fine sensory input in all activities. Combining this with long sitting periods, to develop momentum in khanika samadhi (momentary concentration), makes accessing the fourth vipassana jhana possible and continued equanimity in all activities possible. An unstimulated retreat environment is most suitable for this level of khanika samadhi to the jhanic level of the fourth jhana, and a commitment to continuous mindfulness and noticing throughout the day will maintain this.

## Progression

Criteria: You are ready to progress to training for Sotapanna: Stream Entry. Your skill in the samatha (calm) part of the Noble Eightfold Path is now mature, and mindfulness of breathing and accessing the jhanas becomes your daily meditation practice, integrated with periods of insight practice after emerging from jhana, and then carried into walking meditation and mindfulness in daily activities.
