      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"### Step 1: Preparation for meditation\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"In this meditation, you move from lying down in Skill 00 to sitting upright with your legs crossed on a cushion on the floor, on a kneeling stool, or resting on a comfortable, supportive chair.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"Sit in meditation with one palm resting in the other, and feel the awareness of your whole body as you sit in meditation. You will be using awareness of your body as the meditation object.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"### Step 2: Develop mindfulness\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"Mindfulness is the meditative skill of gently remembering (keeping in mind) what you are experiencing now in your body, mind and senses.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"Listen to the flow of sound: Actively listen to sounds around you, the way they flow and change. Allow the presence of sound to develop mindfulness by gently keeping it in mind.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"Feel your clothing on your body: As you relax, you will naturally become aware of your clothing touching your body and the coolness/warmth of air touching your skin.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"### Step 3: Relax your body with slow breaths\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"In MIDL, these slow, relaxing breaths are known as softening breaths because your body and mind become softer as you relax.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"Relax with diaphragmatic (belly) breaths: Take five softening breaths by slowly moving your belly outward and then slowly lowering it back.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"Relax with full-body breaths: Take five more slow inhales, starting in your belly, bringing the breath up to fill your chest, and then, with each exhale, allow your whole body to relax.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"### Step 4: Enjoy the relaxation\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"After taking these softening breaths, allow your breathing to return to its natural rhythm; enjoy the growing relaxation and comfort in your body for the rest of the meditation.\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"## Tips\\n\" +\n",

      "    \"\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"Unable to experience physical comfort. Physical Restlessness refers to feeling of being unsettled in your body, which prompts you to move around and fidget. It occurs during meditation due to the build-up of energy from stress, aversion, or overstimulation in our daily lives.\\n\" +\n",

      "    \"- Hindrance: 01 - Physical Restlessness\\n\" +\n",
      "    \"- Antidote: Developing your skill in relaxing your body creates the conditions for Marker 01. To settle physical restlessness, cultivate curiosity in finding enjoyment as you relax your body with slow, diaphragmatic, belly breaths. As you exhale, allow a part of your body, such as your shoulders, to relax slowly and deliberately so that you can feel the bodily relaxation.\\n\" +\n",
